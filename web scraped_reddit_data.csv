1bzorzf,stress,Im afraid to speak vocally on a vidéo game ,"Hi everyone 



Not long ago I met an extremely nice and understanding person on a video game. Since we can both talk in voice on this game, we had to face the fact that this day would come. 
To explain the situation better, you should know that I have a lot of stress problems that make me have anxiety attacks (like most people here) following past events in my life. 
I see a sophrologist and I used to see a psychologist but I can see that I never have the time to do the breathing exercises that my sophrologist gives me. 
Because of my stress, I can't stand the world (cinema, theater, shopping malls, etc.). 
And so it may seem strange but I can stress through a video game. 
However, in this situation I'm not supposed to be stressed because she's really an incredible person. 
But I might have an idea of why I'm stressing out: last December I made a ""friend"" on the same video game but after several weeks we had a fight and it all went to hell (it might seem really childish that I got attached to this person who didn't deserve my trust) so one day I heard her criticizing me to an unimaginable extent. 
I was afraid of abandonment and especially because at that time I was under a lot of stress, I had the feeling that everyone was coming down on me. 

That day I had experienced my greatest fear. 
Except that with this person we used to talk a lot in vocals, but after that event I didn't really like talking in vocals anymore. 

So I feel like a loser and that I'm exaggerating my reactions for so little, but I don't want to disappoint the person I met recently, especially since he's so nice.
I don't know what to do, please help me. 
Thank you",2024-04-09 10:30:20,3,2,1,Positive,0.04007201646090535,0,0,2
1ehozel,stress,Venting ,"I just need to vent about all the crap going on in my life that is making me feel so stressed and overwhelmed. Ive been married for almost 2 years now and almost the entire length of the marriage it's been crap. We fight a lot, we never had sex, we act like roommates instead of husband and wife. I was diagnosed with cancer last year and have received no support from her. She acts like she doesn't even care. We are getting divorced now. Our apartment lease is about to up next month and I can't find anywhere affordable to live because of all this debt I have and also I miss a lot of work due to feeling ill from treatment. I'm stressing out because I have no where to go, my mom lives in a senior community so even if she wants to help me and let me stay with her she can't. Now my job is threatening corrective action and it makes me feel like I'm going to lose my job. First they were on me because of my schedule adherence. I was using the bathroom a lot because my treatment gives me severe diarrhea. Now they are telling me my work stats are suffering and they need me to get my stats up. What's crazy to me is the stats they are referring to I have never had any problem with and every coaching I have with my supervisor she has never once told me those stats were going down and has instead said the opposite. I feel like they want to push me out. All of this is all happening all at once and I feel like it's driving me insane and idk what to with myself",2024-08-01 19:09:19,3,3,1,Negative,-0.19026199494949494,0,0,0

1eljt8u,careeradvice,22F in corporate looking to get out,"Hi everyone. I’m a 22F and feeling a bit lost in my current position. Here’s some background:

- I graduated college in 2023 (a year earlier than I was supposed to) with a 3.4GPA and a degree in Marketing Analytics. 

- I got a job almost immediately out of college in an industry that I’m not super passionate about, but is still interesting for my field of work. The job is great. It has amazing benefits, good pay, and is family owned which has its perks. I’ve been at my current job for a little more than a year and haven’t had the best experiences so far.

Since the beginning of this year I’ve been feeling indifferent towards my current job. More recently, I’ve found myself dreading going into the office/work in general. Not everyday is a bad day where I currently work, but I definitely have more bad days than good days. I often find myself without tasks due to poor management in the upper levels and I sit in the office most days making myself look busy. In college, I worked in busy restaurants so I always had something to do, so coming into the quiet office life was a bit of a change for me. It was fine at first but now I really find myself no longer enjoying the same aspects of my job that I did a year ago. I also don’t feel like the typical Monday through Friday 9-5 fits the lifestyle I want and I feel like because of that schedule I oftentimes am not able to focus on the things I enjoy (working out, gardening, etc.)

Let me say this: I love what I do. Market Research is a passion of mine and I really enjoy learning about the consumer and their habits. However, since I’ve been feeling stuck in my current position, I have looked at other jobs to apply for. My issue with this is that I’m not technically “Entry-Level” anymore with my experience but I’m also not “Mid-Level” either. This has made the job search harder for me because entry level jobs pay nowhere near what I am currently making but mid-level positions don’t even give me a chance due to lack of experience. I should also mention that I am currently engaged and getting married in November. Because of that, I’ve decided to stay with my current company until the end of the year. My fiancé is in Law Enforcement with a 7-day working, 7-day off schedule. His schedule is something that really appeals to me because I see him being able to pursue his passions outside of his job on the days off he has and I can see how happy his schedule makes him.

The past few months, I’ve been volunteering as a firefighter in my community. I really enjoy the work that I do for my community through that outlet and have looked in to pursuing firefighting full-time. The schedule would be 1-day working, 3-days off and then 2-days working, 3-days off. That sort of schedule definitely sounds like something that I could enjoy. Firefighting is also relatively fast-paced and every shift is different, so I doubt I would get bored with the mundane aspects like I do in my current position. I would also be getting better benefits and retirement, but the pay would be lower than I currently make, especially starting out. The money isn’t much of an issue for me since my fiancé makes enough to supplement the income we would be losing if I leave my current position.

All of this to say: I don’t know what to do. I love the field I work in and want to continue my career and education in marketing analytics, but the stereotypical corporate world is not something that appeals to me. My biggest issue with firefighting is that I’m worried I’ll get into it and then in a few years hate it and want out. I don’t know if I should try to find another job within my field (maybe even remote to give me some more freedom in my day) since the management at my current company is terrible, or if I should completely get out of the corporate world and pursue something completely different in every aspect.

I am young and have time to figure things out, but thinking of changing careers completely scares me. It’s not like I would be going from Marketing to Finance and still be in the business world. I would be getting out of the corporate world completely and starting something totally different that what I currently do. Any advice on what I should do?",2024-08-06 14:52:04,3,2,1,Positive,0.08081501831501832,0,0,2
1c5sw4g,stress,Hey guys I'm wondering if you can tell me if these are the symptoms of stress,"I've been dealing with massive stress for the past 8 years, I'm not going to say too many details but I will say it's someone close to me with a bad addiction to alcohol, as well as a divorce, and money issues due to my son having medical problems and I'm drowning financially.


Now I don't know if I have a health problem or if this is stress, but a stressful situation makes it so much worse and when I'm not in a stressful situation I feel like I'm always at stressed baseline. But it comes intermittently and it doesn't happen all the time it's just about eight times throughout the day.

Symptoms:

Off balance/dizzy

Weakness ( almost feels like hypoglycemia but it's not)

Overall fatigue

Moody

Feeling like blood is rushing to my face ( like when you are hanging upside down on the monkey bars and blood is rushing to my head)

Now I'm not the kind of person to be mean to people, every so often I will raise my voice, but I usually internalize everything. So I pretend like everything is fine even when it's not and I believe that this is really doing serious damage on me.

If I just sit down and I breathe in and out while listening to a stress video or just relaxing in general and counting my breath, 50% or more of this feeling will go away.


Is this the symptoms of chronic stress? I'm 33 years old and I've been dealing with it for so many years now and I am finally starting to feel symptoms of what I believe is chronic stress.

Does anybody else have these symptoms?

Thanks!",2024-04-16 22:08:26,1,2,1,Positive,0.016030092592592585,0,0,2
1erw82a,college,Student Insurance New York,"I am a United States Citizen who has been living in Germany for around 10 years, I will be studying at Columbia this Fall but I have major problems with the health insurance. One problem is I can’t even access the New York health government website, I don’t know if this is because I am out of the country, I would assume so. Another issue is that I don’t know if the basic New York health insurance qualifies me for a waiver, or I need a special plan. I am a low income student so I am trying to not have to pay the Columbia’s automatic insurance that for me is unaffordable. Next is the issue of timing. In Germany when you sign up for health insurance it is pretty much automatic, it does not take months to become active, it’s pretty quick but then you are paying for it- I made the mistake of thinking it would be similar so I waited until the month before to enrol. It turns out that when I enrol today my insurance won’t begin until the next month, but Columbia wants prove that I am insured from the 15th of this month until next year to wave the plan. I am insured in Germany now, but this won’t work for me after leaving the country. I was told by the office that I could have some sort of letter- does anybody know how to navigate this? If anyone knows anything I would be so eternally grateful since this is really stressful. I reached out to the office and they weren’t very helpful.

1c6gr80,stress,Objets efficaces pour lutter contre le stress / ronger ses ongles,"Bonjour à tous,

J'ai 30 ans et depuis aussi loin que ma mémoire peut remonter, je me suis toujours rongée les ongles de manière assez intense. Aussi, en ce moment je vis la période la plus difficile de ma vie et mon anxiété est à son apogée (séparation que je ne souhaitais pas).

J'essaye de mettre tous les atouts de mon côté pour lutter au mieux contre le stress et notamment les moments où je ronge mes ongles. Évidemment, il s'agit souvent de moment où mon corps n'est pas stimulé (regarder un film sur le canapé par exemple). J'aimerais essayer un objet ou plusieurs objets dits ""anti-stress"" mais avant d'acheter quoi que ce soit j'aimerais avoir des retours d'expériences de personnes qui ont eu recours à ce genre d'objets.

Lesquels me conseillerez-vous ? Dans mon cas il ne faudra pas seulement que cela me tienne occupée il faudrait que j'ai une vraie satisfaction à l'ultiliser (au moins égale à celle de m'enlever les peaux qui dépasses par exemples !)",2024-04-17 18:06:48,0,2,1,Positive,0.25,0,0,2
1918bo0,stress,Help lol,"So on Friday i experienced a pain that would come and go on my left side between my armpit and breast. It happened while i was eating some pasta so i stopped bc i started panicking. The pain only occurred about 3 times that day. I figured it was a muscle strain or something bc the pain also radiated to my shoulder blade and i had just done a hiit workout after a 6 months break. I was still worried but my dad owns a Pulse oximeter and i asked him if he check me and everything seemed fine which helped me calm down. The next day (yesterday) i had pain around my chest and there was a moment where my lower back hurt when I’d breathe in deeply. My mom made me tea and it helped me tremendously. So then i figured it was just acid reflux since I suffer from GERD. Then today, i also felt extremely jittery and can almost feel my heartbeat and cried because i had the urge too. Is this stress?? Anxiety?? Like what’s happening lol.

Other factors that may help: i did get bloodwork done about two weeks ago and everything came out fine except high cholesterol (202) and low iron & vitamin D. I just started taking supplements two days ago. My dr also said nothing looked to urgent to have sooner appt. (I’m going in Feb.) The week of Christmas i also dealt with fast heartbeat anytime I’d want to go to sleep and i mentioned it to my dr but she sort of dosed it off and told me to get bloodwork done and that was that.

1epy2dp,careeradvice,10 Years in Retail — Where Can He Go?,"Hello all,

Let me preface this by saying: this isn’t for me. This is for my partner. He’s been working at a popular retail store for just over 10 years now, and worked his way from a part time associate to a key holder merchandiser.

Long story short, I’ve been noticing that his mental/emotional health has been negatively impacted by his superiors. From what he’s told me and also from what I’ve overheard at outings with his coworkers (weddings, birthday parties, brunches in which I am the +1), their store is a top performing store. They pass their audits, they usually rank high when it comes to sales in their region, and he typically gets praised for being a hard worker. But I guess the managing team makes their jobs a bit more difficult with inconsistent scheduling, piling on responsibilities on the merchandisers, and just being straight up unprofessional and rude.

Yesterday, he had an anxiety attack about work that was (1) kind of frightening for me to witness and (2) making me upset that they were putting him through this much stress. I told him to call off, but he said he couldn’t because the department managers took the day off.

Anyway, when the time comes and when he’s ready to transition out of that job, I would like to be able to help him land a role elsewhere. He’s put himself back in school for fashion marketing, but he’s always wanted to be a buyer. Does anybody have tips on how to become a buyer?

On a more general scale, what jobs are out there for those with this much retail experience? He unfortunately does not have a degree yet (again, he’s working on it), but he has great discipline, and learns quick. What jobs have you all had luck getting with just retail history at one place?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Right now, he’s stuck in a vicious cycle of just needing to grin and bear it. I absolutely hate this for him.",2024-08-11 22:58:21,1,2,1,Positive,0.020690476190476193,0,0,2
1es435c,stress,14m always stressed no serious reason or issues,"Idk where to even begin. I like being funny and making ppl smile and i try to be energetic and funny all the time. I love it and came to being pretty popular? Im great at becoming close with new ppl. But because im looked at as the “funny guy” nobody really takes me serious. I cant remember how long its been since ive gad a real serious casual conversation with anyone. Nobody really cares i guess. Im great at becoming friendly with new ppl but suck at really making long term close friends. Theyr all temporary. Im nobodys “best friend” im nobodys #1. I know im being dramatic but i feel so painfully lonely even tho i have tons of ppl around me. Everyone expects me to be funny so i try to be every chance i get but as soon as i start talking about my feelings or my views or a genuine conversation everyone stops listening. So i find myself starting a genuine conversation and speak my mind but lose confidence and cut it short and go back to my usual facade once i notice that nobody seems to care. I just want someone that really listens. I just want a genuine friend.im not saying everyone i know is fake. Not at all. I appreciate all of them,they just happen to not think of me as a close friend. Thats not my fault or theirs. This is killing my social life. Im “popular” and “the funny guy” i guess. Nobody really dislikes me but nobody really cares either. Especially this girl “Manami” weve been in the same class i the 7th and 8th grade and for 2 years i couldn’t get her off my mind and this year were in different classes and i cant get her off my mind even more. Were realllly close she says im her best male friend and shes the only girl that genuinely talks to me. But again im supposed to be “the funny guy” im a clown. She cant take me seriously or think of me as a love interest. If i dont say or do anything funny what good am i? I want her so bad. Shes the only thing i think about lately.

Rashes, heavy chest, twitching eyes and what feels like indigestion all the time. These are the symptoms I currently have, and they just wont budge even with a healthy lifestyle (vegan, exercise, meditation, good sleep etc). I believe these to be symptoms of stress because I've had the most stressful 7 years of work, I've just recently quit this job, and this is when these symptoms really intensified. I've also done bloodwork and other tests to confirm that its not something else.

1elpwxc,careeradvice,I’ve got a career problem that’s concerning me. ,"To give some background leading up to this:

- I went to university non-traditionally. Took me ten years but I graduated in 2017. I went to class part time and enjoyed sharply discounted tuition by working for the same university in their IT dept. It was a great setup and I’m thankful because it means graduating without any student loan debt. It also meant ten years of learning a lot in the IT world. 

- I moved on to work for a major healthcare corporation as my first post-graduate job and I loved it. Got stuff done, tickets closed, got to be part of project work, and change requests, and enjoyed the casual corporate culture. It was amazing. 

- then came the hiring boom of 2021. Several of our knowledgeable engineers left the company for other roles that paid better. Great for them, not great for me and those who stayed to see where things would go with the company. A private equity firm bought out a controlling stake in the company and began slashing everything in sight to position it for a major buyout. My team went from 40 down to 10.

- I was then approached by our director to consider a management role within the company for our team of ten. Thinking I had finally made it big, I accepted. It came with a big pay raise so I was excited. My first six figure job!! But……this is where the problem started. 

- almost a couple weeks in I noticed I was starting to lose sleep. I wanted everyone on my team happy. So I did everything I could within servant leadership style to get what they needed. But then HR and folks in finance started the “bell curve” ratings system meaning I deliberately had to lie about my team’s performance on reviews so that only one or two got the top ratings and the rest got “meh” ratings. It was disgusting to me and I felt dirty. 

- fast forward another two years….and I’m overwhelmed. Our company is bought out by a larger corp, my awesome director has been transferred away from us, while big corp sends in a new director who has no clue what he’s doing and is standoffish from all of us. My team looks entirely to me for answers on their jobs, where things are going, and I’m asking our new director……no one will tell me anything. I ask our VP, and she won’t even tell me, she has no clue either. So I have no answers for the team and feel worthless as a boss. 

- it was at this point I was beginning to enter what I think might’ve been depression, and a low point in my career where I just wanted out any way I could. I just wanted to quit. 

- I talked to a former colleague who put in a referral for me at their workplace. A management job but it paid WAY better and came with some nice perks and would get me out of this other job. Out of desperation, I went for it, interviewed, and got the job. All remotely. 

- Four months into this new job, I had definitely been a fool. I was in over my head, overwhelmed, sobbing every night after work, stressed, and barely sleeping. My health was going downhill, and I was gaining weight from stress eating. Eventually, a family member started showing concern and I also learned of a situation in the family I had to help deal with at the same time I was going through this. At this point, I made the difficult decision to resign from that job and take two weeks off to deal with this issue and focus on trying to gain my health and sanity back. 

- two weeks later, I’ve interviewed and stated a job at an MSP. Things start off well and fine. I’m just a level 3 support engineer here. No people management required in this job. However, where things started off great, now the company has begun to clamp down hard on cost cutting measures, corporate initiatives, and making micromanagement moves that’s starting to stress out and unnerve a lot of folks on my team. I’m seeing the same patterns unfold as I did when my previous company from two jobs ago got positioned for buyout. 

So with all of that background above, here is where I am today. Tired all the time, stressed out every day, health going downhill again, ready once again to jump ship after 8 months here. 

From a career standpoint I was full of optimism and hope for the future when I graduated university. That’s all but gone now. I don’t know what to do or where to go from here. I’ve been from IT help desk all the way to management and back. All I’ve ever actually wanted to do was project and implementation work especially if travel is involved. But I’ve never been given that chance. 

I don’t want to job hop too much since that looks bad on the resume, but what else do I do? Not sure if I’m burned out, in a bad spot mentally, or what, but it’s scaring me and I’m not sure where I need to take my career right now. I’m just tired of being tired, stressed, and overweight in IT jobs that don’t bring any enjoyment or fulfillment anymore. ",2024-08-06 18:53:36,1,0,1,Positive,0.032622318277438764,0,0,2

These last 3 months I’ve realised how I really hate working here - I’m in a field that requires a large amount of training and for signed off competency for legal reasons, however within these 3 months I’ve received 1 weeks worth of training and have just been doing the same repetitive task since then. This job just doesn’t align with what I want out of a job.

I’m just worried about leaving my current role after 3 months, as this will probably look really bad on my CV, but there are far more reasons than just training that I dislike.

1enwxor,careeradvice,How do I cope with my fear of authoritarian figures at work/school?,"I tend to fear authoritarian figures at work/school. This has been bothering me for a while. It has been affecting my self-image, reputation at work/school, skills/ability and overall well-being since the last 2 years. I tend to overthink when I am communicating with my boss/supervisor or carrying out some responsibilities. I get jump scares sometimes after coming back from work/school when I think about how embarrassing I really was that day while I spoke with them.

I either think or work clumsily or overthink and make the task even harder for me to do. I also tend to hurry and finish while forgetting to look at the important details even when I have more than enough time. I suck at prioritizing my tasks too, so I tend to mess up when I am given multiple things to carry out. This has created some unnecessary stressful situation for me at work/school. I know I have the skills, and I know what to do because the moment people tell me that I could have thought about this problem in question in a different way, I suddenly get a moment of realization, but that doesn't help me or my reputation. For this reason, I am seen as an incompetent person. So, I feel insecure and tend to shy away from networking/building connections.

Is there any way that I can try to figure out where it is coming from and take the responsibility for it, and possibly, find a solution? If there's anyone who struggled with this and was able to overcome, please let me know how you coped with it and found a way to reduce the fear. Masking it or faking confidence didn't work for me as the mask fell off during the moments of stress.

I am a socially anxious person if that matters because I do think it also has its influence in this.",2024-08-09 11:08:44,9,5,1,Negative,-0.048749999999999995,0,0,0

Thanks so much again!


I, 31F, was recruited by a consulting firm and was told that I would be receiving $50/hr as a 1099 contractor. After I quit my original job, the president informed me that he lost the main contract but would still bring me on at $25/hr. He mentioned that he was signing a new contract that should be finalized in about 60 days, at which point he would adjust my pay. We agreed, signed the contract for $25/hr, and he promised to send me a new contract soon. I started working for him, but only a couple of hours a week, so I was making minimal money, but I was okay with it because my savings were enough to last for a couple of months.

Payments were inconsistent—just a few hundred dollars here and there or $60, $80 etc. Sometimes at night on a Saturday, or whenever, In total, I was receiving $500-$800 a month. I kept asking for the new contract, and he kept saying, “I’ll send it soon.” I didn’t press too hard because he assured me that everything would be back-paid. Fast forward to February, I set up a meeting to discuss my pay. He told me that he would not be giving me a raise because I was already earning above minimum wage. After that, I informed him that I would be looking for another job and gave my notice.

He was a consultant at an institution where I had previously worked. They made me false promises about a new position, but never followed through, so I felt like I was being used. He believed that I should be paid more for the amount of work I was doing.

I trained my replacement, whom he found within the same week, likely with similar false promises. Lol.

Two months later, a friend referred me to another firm that is his competitor. I was hesitant, but they have a great reputation, so I applied. I interviewed and got the job. It’s a salaried position, and I’m receiving a great salary plus quarterly bonuses.

There was a contract he was supposed to assist my new firm with, but the budget was slashed, and his portion was no longer needed because the company that hired my firm decided to handle it internally. I feel that he is telling people it was my fault that his firm couldn’t partner with mine because it would have been a great opportunity for him. However, the budget was slashed even before I applied.

I’ve been attending conferences where I occasionally see my old boss. Of course, I say hello and try not to feel any guilt, but I do because I feel like he’s the type to paint me as the villain in his story.

Am I the asshole here? I wasn’t paid properly but kept working and doing everything I was supposed to do. No adult can survive on less than $1,000 a month. I don’t want to explain my side of the story to people in the industry because it’s no one’s business, but I don’t want anyone damaging my reputation. I work hard, and he even used to speak highly of me before all of this. We will always be in similar spaces and I hate the anxiety that comes with it.

1dwouml,university,Faked 2 years of university life ,"TLDR —> Failed first year of Uni, about the fail my re-take year. Developed habitual lying, avoidance and procrastination which is destroying my life. 

I am 21 years old. I enrolled into Chemical Engineering BEng 2 years ago at Sheffield Hallam University. I failed my first year, and I’m about to fail my retake year. Thinking about moving to the University of Sheffield to study English Literature BA. 


Let’s start with GCSEs. I did well. A top grade of 9 (A*) in English Literature, 8 in RE, 7 in Chemistry etc. Some good grades. Maths let me down. I got an average pass, grade 4. Never really enjoyed it.


But I love English. I’m naturally very good at it, even as a child. I wrote books, poetry and joined competitions. But societal pressures and lowkey parental expectations caused me to think of finding a more lucrative career/degree. 

The summer before starting A-levels, I told my parents I’ll become a doctor because I loved the TV shows. I took a summer internship at NHS and medic mentor. That passion died out quickly. 

A-levels results day. I initially wanted to take Chemistry, maths and physics. I couldn’t take them because I didn’t know that a grade 6 in maths was required to take any science A-level. How silly. 



So I decided to take A-level English Literature, sociology and philosophy at an amazing Sixth-Form. I was on track for an AAA*, top of my class. Loved the environment, teachers, buildings, friends etc. I was selected to visit the university of oxford for an exclusive tour for A-level students with potential. I really wanted to become a lawyer at that point and study law at the University of Oxford. 

Until, i dropped out 6 months into it. Huge shock for my parents. At the time, i thought i disliked the repetitive essay writing in English Literature. I was so naive. I didn’t hate it, and I should’ve recognised that this was normal struggle. I loved my other 2 subjects- philosophy and Sociology. I felt like I didn’t enjoy my a-levels when really, I just wasn’t feeling stimulated. I thought STEM would be the career for me. After all, I do have decent grades in chemistry and physics. Not maths however. I thought that even with my not so natural aptitude/passion for maths, I could study hard and achieve it anyway. Boy, I was so wrong. 



I instead took a BTEC National extended diploma  at Sheffield College in applied science, where I achieved grades DMM. I didn’t do as well as I hoped. Despised the new environment and the kinds of people there overall. I didn’t make any real friends here. Liked some modules though. This is where my mental issues started to arise due to the change of environment from college vs sixth form. I started procrastinating heavily, skipping classes and started making lies and excuses to push back exam dates. Eventually, I started to become a habitual liar to protect my reputation (even in personal life). My professor referred me to a mentor who suggested I get some therapy for stress management. It was via phone call which i hated. i prefer face to face. The therapy didn’t help and never went anywhere. It worked out in the end with my grades, but barely. I wanted a D*DD. 

I then went into Sheffield Hallam Chemical Engineering. I thought lowly of this school, kept comparing myself to my boyfriend who went to a ‘real university’ (as my uni’s security guard said).  My whole class were all guys (besides one other girl). I didn’t make any friends in my course. I started off really strong, engaging lots and showed enthusiasm. Fresh start. I really stood out amongst my professors. I really gaslit myself for 2 years into thinking I enjoyed the material. 

Then I got punched in the face with how difficult the maths got. Everyone else seemed to know the answers. They all did A-level maths. I’m stuck at GCSE level. I could NOT let myself be seen as an imposter or embarrassment. Especially after showing everyone how confident I was at the beginning. For the first time, I felt stupid in a class. I avoided asking for help, but most of all, got so intimidated and bored of the maths heavy modules. It spiralled out of control. Eventually skipped all lectures, seminars, labs, exams. Everything. The same procrastination, skipping and lying continued into my 2 years at Hallam. 


I went to a few counselling sessions that the uni provided after I realised it was really getting out of control. This was where they suspected ADHD, l sometimes noticed extreme cycles of going between very productive to a depressive slump. I frequently suffer from slumps, but they’ve never been as bad as the ones i’ve experienced 5 months ago. I want to continue therapy. 


Habitual lying, avoidance and procrastination. Its eating my up inside. It caused me to lie about my driving exams which I didn’t turn up to 3 times now, and lied about it each time. I lied, made excuses and elaborate stories about a lot of big responsibilities since then. What started off as small white lies snowballed into a massive pile of deception. I lied so I can preserve my reputation and image that I have of myself. Naturally, everyone else was tricked into this. I’m SICK of living a façade and living with the anxiety of being ‘found out’. I live a fake life to fulfil these fake stories to different people. Always thinking ‘how do I explain this’ or ‘hmm, what story shall I make up to cover xyz in case they ask?’



I feel like a failure and that I’ve disappointed my family, friends and partner. I lied for 2 years about my grades at Sheffield Hallam and said that I’m doing well and enjoying it. I wasn’t. I hated the school, subject, people. And i didn’t say anything about it. They still think that I’m about to start my last year. I also feel like a failure because for 1 year i struggled to afford my rent. They had to pay my other half of rent every month for a year, and they struggled mentally and financially because of this. I also kept giving them false hope because i’d always tell them i’m doing fine and taking on these new exciting projects. Why did it take me this long to realise I didn’t actually enjoy it??? These behaviours are ruining my life and i’ve gone untreated for too long- almost 4 years now.

I now want to pursue English Literature BA at the University of Sheffield with a Foundation Year. I don't meet the standard requirement, but I want to have a shot applying as a mature student, and explain my situation to be considered for additional consideration.

18us58d,stress,Panic attacks and losing hope,"Hi everyone,

  
I started having panic attacks one year ago when I was in a really high-pressure engineering school while living abroad and alone at 18 years old. I quit that school due to horrible mental and emotional abuse from teachers and the extreme amount of stress, and returned to my country. 

  
I was quickly diagnosed with panic disorder, and had the most horrible panic attacks every single day for months. I did counselling and a couple of sessions of EMDR therapy for six months. Now it's been one year, and I went to study abroad again and changed my degree, but after all this therapy, I'm still experiencing panic attacks. 

  
Even though they're not as frequent (once every 1-2 weeks) and not as intense as they were before, I am so exhausted from battling with this. I still have horrible anxious thoughts and nights where I cannot breathe and feel like I'm dying. 

  
I am starting to lose hope that this disease will ever go away. I am so scared and getting depressed and hopeless, and the fact that I'm alone in a foreign country is not helping. 

  
I was wondering if it's possible to fully recover from a panic disorder, and to not have panic attacks and live a happy life?",2023-12-30 22:49:13,4,3,1,Negative,-0.08698721913007627,0,0,0

1d57sk4,academia,Temporary lecturer role after PhD(CS) ,"[](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProfessors/?f=flair_name%3A%22Career%20Advice%22)

Context: I am US based so would prefer US-based Professors perspective from STEM or CS field.

I am offered a lecturer role which is limited term but can go up to 2 years at max at an R1 university and I'm currently ABD graduating in a few months. I heard that if you take the lectureship route right after your PhD, you're essentially saying goodbye to tenure track positions in future. I'm curious as I'm not interested in PostDoc at this point in my life which is not only underpaid than a lecturer position, it is also more laborious. On the other hand, lectureship would help me get some teaching experience as i have none. I have two young adorable kids whom I've pretty much neglected during my PhD and I'm longing for some work-life balance. I had particularly stressful PhD where the advisor would literally call at odd times to tell that I'm not doing enough and would ask to meet unrealistic deadlines every semester. I have pretty good publication record and I hope to continue publishing while being in a temporary lecturer position and hope to go for an Assistant Professor position in an R2 institute next year.

I was recently interviewed for an R2 institute which fell through but they told me i wouldn't have to chase grant money and will be given sufficient funds to sustain myself and the lab so the job was mostly 40% teaching,40% research and 20% service which was too good to be true and exactly right up my alley. I couldn't get it this time which could be due to zero teaching experience but am i killing my chances to ever land an TT AP position by taking this lecturer role? I don't understand people's fear of a lecturer role after PhD. Even my own advisor told me a lecturer's role should be the least in the priorities. To be honest, i also do not have any job offer other than this one at the moment.

Im confused if I'm really killing my academic career here. Advise please.",2024-05-31 22:16:44,5,1,1,Positive,0.11285714285714285,1,0,2

1ehncff,stress,Stess Addict missing being stressed,"26M. I know without a doubt I am a addicted to stress. I am a workaholic. I used to be an exercise junkie, but I can't do that anymore to the intensity that I used to be able to because of injuries. And now I have been settling into a new career working in finance as a work from home job. And at this point I'm considering finding something whether it is a supplement, or whatever to get my heart rate about 90-100 bpms to last several hours. It's like at 60-70bpms, my attitude is lazy, I don't care as much, I'm not as motivated. I'm naturally a multi-tasker too, but it's easier at 90bpms than 60bpms.

The stakes just don't feel real. Too feel stressed at this point, means I care about something. To not feel stressed about it, to not feel the adrenaline in the moment means I don't care about it, and I'm wondering if I should be doing something else, or mentally find sometype of goal to be obsessed with.

At this point, I'm not even concerned about future goals, financial goals, because none of it feels real if I'm not in a high stressed state and that is exactly how an addict is. ",2024-08-01 18:02:51,3,5,1,Positive,0.017433155080213897,0,0,2

1dft768,academia,Ethics situation with former advisor regarding predatory journal ,"TLDR: my old advisor submitted work I did more than 3 years ago with “minor edits” to a known predatory journal without telling me first or showing me the final version to review and I’m not sure how to handle this and worried either choice I make (ignoring and letting it be published or going to the university with a complaint if my name is not retracted) could damage my career. 

Hi all, 

I’m in the middle of what feels like a complicated mess with my former graduate advisor. I’m getting some different advice from different people and it’s really starting to affect me; I have Crohn’s disease and stress is a big trigger for me and this is really making me physically ill. 

About two weeks ago I received a text from my former advisor from my masters program (biology) stating that they had submitted my masters thesis for publication. This work was from 2020; I have not heard from them in 3 years. When I graduated and they encouraged me to publish, I made it clear I was not interested in publishing but sent them all my raw data and figures so they could publish if they wanted to. I felt obligated to do this as I know the university technically owns my research, so I can’t really stop them from publishing work I did in their lab. Suffice it to say that Covid affected my experience there and I felt like the study was a bit of a sham; it was hurried and I received very little help from them. I did the best I could with what I had and the paper was good enough to graduate but not something I felt was worth publishing or would even be accepted. It was a very simple project with what I think are several flaws in the methodology and conclusions. I went on to start a PhD program where I have since received a lot of support from my new advisor and learned how to be a much better scientist. Unfortunately for many reasons I did decide to master out with a second masters this past December and am now looking for a job while staying home with my infant.

Anyway, our last communication was about three years ago when I was graduating from my first program and now all the sudden they reached out to tell me they submitted it with “minor edits” for publication. They reminded me that per our last communication I asked them to take care of publishing. Stretching the truth a bit, more like I didn’t want it published but recognized I didn’t own the data and just asked to be acknowledged some how if they did publish. Well I was put as first author. I was a little alarmed at first; since graduating from that program I have coauthored three other papers and each time I had to confirm my authorship to the journal and sign off that I reviewed and approved of the work submitted. No such thing happened this time. I communicated this concern and asked what journal they submitted to and they said it was one of the journals under Scientific Research, or SCIRP. After a little bit of research it turns out it’s a well known predatory journal. You can google this if you’re unfamiliar and quickly find out that most view it as bogus/sketchy at best, and devastating to my career at worst. 

I was trying not to overreact, and just requested that my advisor send me the final version they submitted so I can review. I tend to overreact when I’m upset or alarmed and regret things I say and do once I’ve calmed down so I’m really trying to work on thinking through things harder before doing anything rash. They said they were sick and would do it the following week, which made this feel sketchier. 

A week went by and I received nothing so I bit the bullet and emailed the journal to let them know I did not review the final version that was submitted under my name and to please halt publication until I am sent the final version. This was really hard for me to do because I knew this would reflect really badly on my old advisor and ruin our relationship. I might not care except that they are relatively well connected locally and I am hunting for a job- I am worried they may be able to sabotage me. Anyway, it turns out, the journal didn’t even care. I had a brief and bizarre correspondence with them where they basically just provided me with status updates and let me know it was already accepted. Completely did not address the fact that I said my work was submitted with me as first author by someone else without me seeing or reviewing it. They didn’t even contact my former advisor to ask what was up with this.

I have now reached out to my old advisor to let them know my discomfort with this situation and to request that my name is pulled from authorship. I honestly don’t have the bandwidth to review the article right now and honestly even if it’s fine how they reformatted/edited it, from what I have learned of this journal I want my name pulled anyway. 

How far should I take this? It feels like a serious ethics violation to me by my advisor? I keep bouncing back and forth between feeling like I’m overreacting and no one will see this paper anyway, and I should maintain my relationship with my old advisor as they are decently well connected locally in the field I am trying to get into, and feeling like this is actually a very serious matter I might even need to bring up to the university.

Anyway thanks for reading all of this if you got this far. All advice is welcomed ",2024-06-14 15:13:14,0,15,1,Positive,0.05097784948637221,0,0,2

1bnpihp,stress,I'm Stressed Regarding Trump and SCOTUS,"It's bad enough that the Supreme Court is aiding and abetting Trump in ensuring he gets the delay he wants with the Election Interference trial, which could consequently lead to Trump winning the election and our democracy coming to an end.  What's worse though is that it's possible that even the three liberals on Scotus (Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson) not only voted in favor of hearing the immunity case but even voted to not hear the case until late April.  I mean, it's one thing if Trump becomes president again and we lose our democracy, but if this ends up happening because even the liberal justices on Scotus were aiding Trump, that would make things so much worse because I mean if Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson voted to hear the immunity case and to hold off on hearing it until late April, then they would have betrayed us and our democracy big time.  Because of this, I am trying every single avenue to find out how the three liberal justices voted when it came to whether to hear the immunity case and when arguments on this case should be heard, but as of now, nothing has worked, and it's leading me so much stress to the point where I'm having trouble focusing on my work in regards to my job.  What can I do?

PS- I know that even if the three liberal justices voted against hearing the immunity case, or at the very least, wanted to hear the immunity case much sooner, it doesn't change the fact that we likely won't get a verdict before the election, but the other justices on Scotus are conservative, therefore, them aiding and abetting Trump with the trial delay is much less surprising.",2024-03-25 21:24:45,0,30,1,Negative,-0.08536796536796534,0,0,0

1eliazt,careeradvice,Need Career Advice: Doctors Without Borders or Sales Team Lead Promotion?,"So I’m currently at a crossroads in my career and could really use some advice. I’m 29 years old and have to choose between two vastly different career paths: working as a Public Communication Officer for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) or taking a promotion to become a Team Lead for a Sales Department.

On one hand, I’ve been a long-time donor to Doctors Without Borders, and working for them has always been a dream of mine since I was a kid. The role seems a lot more chill with benefits like 30 days of holidays and 3 days working from home, compared to 25 days of holidays and 1 day of working from home. However, it comes with less pay and possibly fewer growth opportunities.

On the other hand, becoming a Team Lead in the Sales Department looks great on my resume and offers a gross salary increase/difference of 1k, which is significant here in the EU. It also promises a lot of valuable experience, though right now as an inside account manager I work overtime, for up to 5-10 hours a week which I will most likely continue. Plus, I’ve found being in sales to be quite stressful sometimes.

I figure I could use this experience to move to a better-paying position in another company within 1-2 years. I’ve been asking around, but opinions are pretty divided. Any advice on which path to take? I’m really struggling to decide.",2024-08-06 13:50:11,1,0,1,Positive,0.1825814536340852,0,0,2

I'm 27,M , currently stuck in a job which I don't like. To be Frank it's not the job that is the issue, more with co workers, upper management etc. All my life I have been considered a hard worker, to be Frank while I was in college or previous jobs etc I was able to and used to work 10x more and handle much more stress than this .... Compared to then I know the job is easier and pays more. Only the thing is at my workplace I'm the only one who is shouldering all the responsibilities ( I know I sound condescending to just as I type this , but it really is the case here). it's like the management / my superiors know that they can't get my colleagues to get these responsibilities done, so they have just dumped all the difficult work on me whereas for the rest of them it's almost like they get paid for sitting and seeing phones from 9-4. As many times I've asked them to reduce my workload or put these on a more rotational basis, all they say is after this month , or currently I can't change and stuff like that. So I'm stuck on the fence about what to do next? Should I resign? Because with the current job market not sure if I get another job so easily, or at least pays well in the main city I like.  Also even though it's stressful, it's not like I can't handle the job. Tbf sometimes I feel even  if I was the only employee here I could still manage to get all the work done, it's just that this stress or frustration or anger or idk what it is that's been building up inside me because of this unfair division of work has been eating me up ( am I becoming toxic? ) ... Like lately after coming back home from work ( I have to travel a long distance) I just keep contemplating wether I should continue or resign and end up not doing anything else. Somedays I don't even feel like eating anymore - have like only one or two meals in the entire day. Sleep issues I already had and have exaggerated lately. I tried talking to my parents about it ( kind of have a strained relationship with them) and they just say if you're unhappy quit, but like it's not that easy right. I have a girlfriend, she's much more  career oriented than me ( like one of those type A workaholic people) . Whenever I tried to discuss this with her, she's always said whatever you do I'll support you. I mean I get that but I dont know what's the right thing to do here.

1dw1rjh,stress,Post stress symptoms / work related stress,"Hi,

I have just gone through a very stressful time at work. There was an issue with the start / end dates of projects which resulted in an overlap on my side and I ended up having 3x the normal workload to get through. Before this even had started, I was already in the middle of one of the projects which was full of politics and a disorganised client.

The three months (of hell) basically comprised of the following:

* Extensive work hours - 12 hour days and working on Sundays most of the time. I would get home from work, take a break, see my SO and then pick up again and many evenings would go to bed close to midnight or even after sometimes. I would typically play an hour of high intensity PC games in my break as well (which I dont think was healthy either!).
* Lack of sleep - especially in the last month got by on like 6 hours sleep a night. Because of the general stress at work my sleep quality wasn't good.
* Mundane work - because of general workload in the company I had to get by without the team members I usually would, and I had to end up doing a lot of mundane and detailed work myself as opposed to more high-level writing / supervisory role which I am supposed to do. As a person 40 + yrs old this was actual torture and as I was working at night I pretty much had to chug 2+ beers a night just to get through it. 
* Lack of acknowledgement - working with bosses who don't really care or show acknowledgement for the work hours (nor will likely show it in a bonus cheque) which created an underlying resentment. This even after cancelling leave to help these guys out.
* Actual stress itself - my job is very detailed focussed and there is a lot of stress around worrying that I missed something (which has happened before).
* Moving goalposts - because of the nature of the work (and crap clients) the goalposts kept on moving. Just when I thought the end would be in sight we would get last minute requests and it would break my spirit. 

It ended up all going down such a spiral - because of the factors above my productivity absolutely just tanked and I was probably at like 60% productivity near the last few weeks. Because of fatigue I would need extra time to go over things as my memory was bad and any task would take longer. 

I had a good exercise pattern and my diet was really good and that has completely fallen by the wayside.

Unfortunately I am stuck in this job for the next 2.5 years and I don't really have any options at the moment - I just have to get through it. So thats not going to change.

Anyways - fast forward, I cleared two projects this week leaving only one left which is very reasonable, very manageable and I have the team to do it. I took a day's holiday today and its been great to catch up some sleep! I am however stuck with some of these symptoms and I am hoping someone has some advice as to how to recover:

* Stimulation in normal things - I struggle to find enjoyment in listening to music or watching TV. I find myself skipping through playlists or scrolling through TV and finding nothing to watch or enjoy, and I am an avid music fan! I just don't enjoy or get stimulation from things anymore. 
* Reclusivity - I have become recluse. I don't see friends or go out and do things I enjoy anymore - in fact even today in my off day I had all these ideas of things to do but just no drive to do them or to go see anyone.
* Sex drive - My sex drive is down - like way down. Mentally and physically just have no desire whatsoever. 
* Psysiology - I have developed a severe acne outbreak which I cannot get rid of. I have put on weight as well and my face just looks tired. It feels like the stress of the past few months has aged me by years!
* Lack of drive - I find it extremely difficult to engage in anything that does not give immediate reward or requires some investment, like reading a book. 
* Impulsivity - I don't know why but I become impulsive in my decisions. Its a combination of being too fatigued to think things through properly and choosing the things that gives the most immediate ""kick"".

1eqnn4f,university,Junior deciding if I should from computer science,"I am currently a junior, computer science major. I got into the major late due to switching my major in my sophomore year after transferring schools. My current institution would not let me take courses in my previous major for an entire year, and they only told me after I officially made the switch. I probably would not have switched my major if I had known before. I did not know what to take since at this point I had never explored other career options, I decided on computer science, just to try out. My mom has always encouraged me to take it as a course and I thought it seemed like a useful degree that if anything I could make my minor. After my first semester I made the switch for it to officially become my major.

I thought I enjoyed coding more than I actually do. I was in the honeymoon phase of trying something new and at the time the classes were pretty easy. Now, it's been a year, the classes are getting harder and I honestly do not enjoy coding that much. I do not hate it, and I would not hate if I was doing it for the rest of my life but I am not necessarily passionate.

I am now scared about continuing the major because of the hard classes and the risk of losing my scholarship. I am also scared because the next semesters are going to be extremely difficult since I started a year late and my first year I only took a couple coding classes since my first semester I was still really unsure. I know people say not to worry about the time you graduate but I can't graduate late. I have a scholarship that only pays for 4 years and pressure from my family that is already annoyed that I am not graduating early.

I have people in my ear telling me computer science is useless without experience or side projects which I know is true and to be honest I do not have enough passion for coding to be coding a bunch of side projects in my free time. I also constantly have people telling me I should be scared to lose my scholarship since it requires a minimum of a 3.0 to maintain, if I lose it I would feel like I disappointed everyone in my family including myself.

I then also struggle with not knowing what else I would major in. I do like how broad computer science is. As someone as indecisive as me I think it is great that I am in a broad major right now as my last major was not broad at all. I also have decided I most likely will get my masters and hopefully by then I have more of an idea of what I want to do exactly so I can get my masters in something I am passionate in and just combine the two.

I am worried I am putting myself through pursing an extremely difficult major for no true purpose since I am not passionate. I wonder if there is another major that is as broad that could benefit me just as much but every time I do research and think about switching it always leads back to computer science.",2024-08-12 19:58:24,1,0,1,Positive,0.05884968904335103,0,0,2

**First Day / Inclusive Access/  Equitable Access / Get All Your Textbooks from Bookstore model** - be careful about these programs. Whether you actually save money through the program greatly depends on your circumstances (major, campus, preferences). These programs propose a ""solution"" to a problem they created - that discount they give you is calculated from what you would spend buying a brand new item vs what you would spend renting a used item. This is not the only way to save money, and the price will increase every year. It likely surprises no one that the bookstore is here to make a profit - don't assume because they have university branding that they have your best interest. These programs through the contract often try to make other units on campus be quiet about your options for affordable resources or help financially. They've also been shown to use ""dark pattern"" or misleading processes to opt out. The Dept of Education is likely going to impose regulations on them in the coming years.

**Online Books ""in the Public Domain""** - by this, I'm referring to books that are past copyright and freely available online, i.e. Great Gatsby, Communist Manifesto, etc. It's always good to check if a free copy is available, but you may want to verify with your professor if you're free to use that copy. You can find these on sites like Project Gutenberg, Hathi Trust, Internet Archive, etc. 

**OER** - you may or may not have heard about OER resources. OER stands for Open Educational Resources, and they are picking up steam on college campuses. They're essentially digital, free, accessible textbooks/resources that are created and purposefully meant to lower costs for students, increase access to needed resources, include digital accessibility, and create a more sustainable ecosystem for teaching. Free resources for a more open education! If your professor uses an OER resource, make sure to give'm kudos - faculty usually have to invest their own time in exploring these low cost/no cost options, and it's because they care about you!

Think critically and always advocate for yourself! Even if it takes you a little more time to explore your options, you could save yourself (and other students) a lot of time, money, and stress!

Sorry if this is considered off-topic, I just think I need academia-specific advice instead of r/socialanxiety.

I went to my first big conference (applied math). I have anxiety/MH problems and was jet-lagged, had spent a few days meeting people and discussing their papers, some suggested collaboration, it was going well enough.

I wanted to ask a question after a talk and started having a kind of anxiety attack, I pushed through and it got so bad someone stood up in front of the mic and said something so I'd have an opportunity to sit back down. Thanks to them by the way.

Everyone looked concerned because I act extremely weird and say things that don't make sense when I'm in this state. Most of them are professors are top schools. It doesn't feel great to remember this.

How bad is that for a career in research? Suppose someone met me again and remembered me, would that impact their opinion/change their mind about collaborating?

1ep4sc5,careeradvice,38M wanting to earn more. What's my best bet?,"I graduated college in 2009 with a BA in mathematics. I started working at a well-known standardized test preparation company during my final years in school teaching SAT prep courses, then get a job as an admin assistant at one of their field office. I spent the next 15 years working for them in various roles, mostly focused on operations management and recruiting.

In 2022, one of my old bosses from this company gave me the opportunity to join her in a new venture she was starting, an education startup that sells an online professional development platform (mainly for teachers and school psychologists) to school districts. I am the VP of Operations there, and have been for the past 2.5 years. We're a really small company - we only have three employees, including myself, the CEO and the Founder. I have helped with so many different things in this role, including accounting, recruiting, customer success, SOP development, compliance, etc., but can't say that I'm truly a master at any one of these things.

When I look at JDs for other VP of Operations roles at other companies, I tend to feel intimidated, and underqualified. I haven't really managed a team of full time employees at any point in my career (except for a failed 6-week stint at company in Dubai during which I had 20 or so full time employees reporting to me - but that's another story), so that's a big weakness in my application.

Some things I'm good at: very strong excel skills, strong writing skills, good people skills, fairly good at designing operational processes, customer service. If anyone is serious about offering advice, I'm happy to share my resume.

I currently make $105k and am trying to figure out how I can earn more. I'm in the middle of a conversation with my current employer about a raise, but I'm not feeling optimistic that I'll get anything meaningful. I'm looking at other companies and applying, and a couple companies have given me multiple interviews, but both rejected me (one was a director of operations role at a nonprofit, and they ended up hiring someone with much more relevant experience than I have; the other was for a VP of operations role at a tutoting startup - I felt that this one was a near-perfect fit, but they rejected me due to lack of experience managing large teams).

I'm feeling a little lost and overwhelmed about what my next move should be. What is the best use of my limited time? Should I just grind it out and apply to jobs broadly? Should I try to go back to school in some form to grow my skill set? Is there a specific type of job I should be targeting based on my skillset? Should I see a career coach? Should I try to get a side hustle?

I'd love to hear from anyone who has been here before and gotten to a better place. My goal, obviously, is to earn as much as possible, but what if I could get to around $150k as a next step, I'd be happy.

1e7ajrc,stress,Any tips on dealing with stress/anxiety caused by family issues?,"Hi everyone. My anxiety initially started over a year ago as health anxiety. However, after the process of getting everything checked out and coming back clear, I ended up becoming more sensitive to anything that could trigger anxiety.

Now, my anxiety and panic attacks are related to issues in my household. I have a sibling who is 28 years old and refuses to get a job and support the house or do anything, which causes problems with my parents. This sibling has been receiving help and support from my parents but they just throw the help out the window and do things they shouldn’t.

Basically, this sibling and my parents will fight and argue at random times about it gets ugly, and whenever I feel that there’s a possibility of it occurring (or when they do start fighting), I get extremely anxious, heart starts beating fast, shakes and shallow breathing.

How can I overcome this? Any tips?

18qd2ng,stress,Am I stressed?,"Let me explain. I’m going to be very concise with this, as there is a lot of backstory but I want to keep this quick.

I(21 M) am someone who NEEDS alone time. I am an introvert and I like being by myself. My entire life I have always had zero privacy. Family, friends, etc. I just have no privacy. I live with my friends in an apartment, and my family at home during summer. 

To cope with my stress a few years ago I began smoking weed. It really helps relieve my stress, but the problem is it’s almost impossible to smoke at my house because my parents are constantly checking in on me opening my door (like every hour or so someone will come in). Keep in mind this is at night, during the day I am busy either hanging with them or at work or school. Once they FINALLY go to bed around midnight I can smoke (I keep it to carts to reduce smell, my dad has a bloodhound nose). The only issue is both my parents wake up throughout the night constantly and will open my door to make sure I am asleep everytime. 

The reason I stay up late is so I can have my alone time, but I can’t enjoy that because they’re always coming in. I love them very much, but it is just way too much for me. And if I tell them I need privacy I know they’ll be sketched out and ask what I am hiding or why I need this privacy. They’re amazing people, just very very intrusive, and to be fair I have problems sleeping so they’re worried I don’t sleep.

I guess I just needed somewhere to vent.",2023-12-25 06:28:32,4,6,1,Positive,0.14331955922865014,0,0,2

1d1aq90,stress,"Unsure if I have ADHD or not, unsure how to get better","I have been pretty busy with college, especially in the last year. I studied abroad, had family and personal drama, am obtaining 2 majors + a minor, run a school club, and ran two large school events with minimum previous experience doing so, running an ongoing research project outside of classes, in addition to moving once and planning a 2nd move soon. I'm also having to make plans for juggling family with my graduation soon. Honestly, I just dread all of it- I don't care about graduating any more. I jsut want everything to stop so I can rest some, finally.

  
I have a lot of memory issues, and part of it is definitely stress related. Though I have also always had some degree of memory issue. Just lately, it's pretty bad.

I've wondered if I have ADHD at all. Multiple people have asked if I do in the past, and I do have a habit of ggiving people conversational whiplash from time to time (tho less so lately). Growing up, I would usually forget things that I definitely shouldn't have. I always thougght it was due to carelessness since my grandma told me that if I cared and applied myself, I would remember. It was always the most stupid stuff, like some plan/new rule that was set just an hour or so before. I've realized now that it doesn't matter if I care or not- I jsut forget things. I recently forgot some important work that I needed to do on my research project that was somewhat time sensitive. I made notes in the meeting with my mentor, double checked verbally what to do as I left, and then the moment I sat down at work after the meeting, I didn't remember any of it until the end of the week (like 5 days later). I have an excel sheet I add all of my notes of what to do and appointments to, but I forgot to add it to that because my memory jsut wiped by the time I would have added it.

Lately, my memory issue has just become more pronounced and bad enough that it's affecting many aspects of my life. Food goes to waste more, my diet is horrible, and while I used to be able to keep track of obligations in my head I no longer can without the excel sheet. I'm so burned out too. I barely ahve energy to do much. Organization in the new apartment with new roommate is not grat, and I think it's also part of why this has become more of an issue- my normal way of organizing things is thrown off and I lack energy to do the amount of thought and reorganizing to basically redo the entire apartment in a way that I am used to.

I've also had headsches more lately. Starting Christmas break and for 3 months after, I had chronic headaches. Mostly one sided flashes of pain, close to my eyes and front areas of my head, very localized and kind of like lines and spots of pain. Over the next month or so, they began to fade away. They have greatly gone down though, and I am not having a lot of them now. They are pretty much gone at this point. I've been to my school clinic (I think? I at least mentioned it to them) and their only advice was counselling. I feel so paranopid I might have brain damage or something from stress.

I got a potted plant (small tiny diy cardboard thing with seeds from a school event) recently. I placed it on the shoe rack while I was taking off my shoes inside, and then forgot about it for how ever many days- until I saw dirt on the floor because my cat had knocked it over. Soome of the dirt had gotten on to some shoes on the top rack, and was there 5 days. My roomate (roomie 2) brought it up as I was leaving thru the door to go somewhere (day of 5 of dirt of shoes). I said I would get it once I got back, I forgot, and today roommie 2 said the shoes are stained. I feel so bad. I cleaned them as well as I could. My roommate (roomie 1), with whom I have roomed a whilke and has commented on my stress alot in the past, said I should look into a neurologist or something at this point. I also talked some with roomie 1 about how I grew up in an environemnt that was constantly stressed, and how the child I hated and felt estranged from was only so odd to me because I grew up only knowing myself under duress, and now that I am not in that situation all the time I have since come to understand myself in a more normal context. They brought up how stress stunts growth, can have developmental affects (which it absolutely can), and I should really get this looked into.

  
I feel so worried. I feel a little unsure how to proceed. I will at least get started with a counseling clinic near by. Aside from that, Idk what if I have brain damage. What if I'm on a track to early onset dementia? What else can I do now to mitigate future damage or ill health?

I am trying to eat better and exercise more. I used to be so healthy and athletic (still had memory issues then, but less so). I just have so little energy now. I feel so burned out and tired and hopel;ess. I have the occasional day where my brain is utter mush and I can barely think. Part of me hardly cares that iut feels like I'm watching myself die in real time- in death there is no thought and thus no worry so why should I care? But in living right now, my memory issues are negatively impacting those around me and I feel like I'm almost always hung over. I hate this. I want to fix  this. But I am so busy all the time and have so little energy. I feel like half my energy everyday is spent on just the moment of waking up and being made to be concious and lving. I'm so tired.

edit:I did also offer to repkace the shoes if need be and have cleaned them as I could. My glasses and vision arent great, so its a little hard to see if they have a fiant stain atill.",2024-05-26 20:44:10,1,2,1,Positive,0.021018050879162004,0,0,2
1bdbgpf,students,"Teacher Thinks me and my friend cheated, Really scared, unsure of what to do"," 

For context I am in high school, was in a class, and we were instructed to do an individual timed writing. I had no clue this meant a test per say, and I don't think anyone else really did either. In his words he said something along the lines of ""just a benchmark,"" ""no need to be super worried,"". But, it certainly was in a test format you could say. We had dividers between us and it was inferred throughout the class that we probably shouldn't talk even though he didnt specifically say.

During the test, he was reading what I was writing down over my shoulder for a minute, before going to look at other kids writings. I looked to my friend and whispered something like (Can't fully remember) ""he seemed really interested"", as a joke. My friend didn't acknowledge me, because little did I know my teacher was walking straight towards my desk. He told me, ""you're done,"" and took my writing.

After class, he came to talk with me and my friend. He asked us why we were talking during an assessment, and if we knew the potential consequences. He explained that he could have our parents called, sport teams coaches called, and could give us a zero on the assessment. After he went through that spiel though, he never actually said if he was going to *do* anything, so that's where my uncertainty lies. We told him we weren't talking about the test, and obviously I'd see why he'd have to assume we were lying. It was a stupid mistake on my part, I've usually been able to joke around in that class, but I took it for granted and wasn't cautious enough in that moment.

As for my grade with the assignment, sure I would be upset with getting a zero because it would guarantee I get a B in the class pretty much, (not sure how many points itll be worth) but I'm more worried for my friend if it comes to that. He's struggling with that class and to my knowledge hovering around a 75, and I don't want him to be stuck with a C or potentially even get a D because of my stupidity. As for me personally, I'm more worried about the other potential consequences. A call to my wrestling coach would be fine because my coach is a very chill person, and knows me personally and would give me the benefit of the doubt. My teacher calling my parents would be scary for me, because even if they know I didn't cheat, they'll still be really mad that I messed up my grade over something so trivial. (they care a lot about grades)

I'm really torn on what I should do. I don't have his class for another two days, and am unsure if I should send him an email or just wait until next class to see if he talks with us again. What im worried is if I send him an email, wording it in a way where I said that I didn't cheat (which is true,) would be very hard without sounding like a liar. But then again im concerned if I wait until Thursday that it could end up being worse. My friend thinks that we should just wait until Thursday, and see if he talks to us or not. The biggest thing that's got me so divided, is that during his talk with us, he never actually said we were being punished or that anything was going to happen. He spoke with a tone of finality after he let us go, and instructed us ""To not do it again"". I know someone who had gotten caught cheating blatantly, (google translate all that jazz) and he told them right then that his parents were being called. So maybe we're being let off with a sincere warning? I can't be sure

If this helps at all, he's generally regarded as a ""not nice"" teacher, but always liked me and my friend. Please give me any advice.",2024-03-12 23:00:49,2,3,1,Positive,0.0565162037037037,0,0,2

We are both from WI, but have lived in other states over the years.  We lived out of state with our children for 2 years, but a job unexpectedly brought us back to WI.  We do like the community here and live in a good school district.  However, my husband does not think he has anywhere to go in his current company and has not found anything local that interests him with similar pay.  He is also concerned about his current job and the long term stability.

My husband is a born and raised Wisconsinite.  He has an attachment to the state of WI.  I moved to WI going into the 3rd grade, because we moved a little bit for my Dad's job.  I did not grow up around extended family.  I do not have an attachment to the state like my husband, and am open to other locations (particularly warm climates).  We were in a western warm climate state for 2 years with our children and loved it.  We were supposed to move to NC, but the housing market and overcrowded schools sent us back to WI (it was an option).  I was not ready to go back to WI, if ever.  

My husband has been presented a job opportunity in Idaho that he thinks he would really enjoy.  He currently makes about $190,000, this new job would be an extra $50,000-$90,000 (depending on bonus) after taxes, higher cost of insurance, etc. etc.

My husband's parents are currently 2 hours away from us now, as well as other extended family on his side.  My sister and her family are 30 minutes away.  We are not very close to our extended family, but do appreciate time with them.  We don't want to hurt our children in any way, whether through leaving family again, or changing schools again.  However, we don't necessarily want to pass up this opportunity.  Do we leave our current location and raise our family in ID?  Are the opportunity and pay increase worth it (savings for college, retirement)?  We realize nothing has to be forever, but we are looking at this as long term, as we wouldn't want to move our children again.  Are we clinging to familiarity?

1ejs3lg,careeradvice,Thoughts on long term career plan/what to incorporate? Engineering degree to navy to finance,"Am currently mechanical engineering undergraduate at Imperial College. Considering applying to the Navy after graduating for the role of Aircrew Officer Pilot. This involves officer training at Britannia Royal Naval College and flying jets, and has an initial commission of 12 years. I do not know if I would want to stay on for 12 years, but the required return of service is \~7 years I believe. After this, I would intend to enter into finance: my current interests are investment research, investment banking and quantitative analysis, but I have not decided which is most attractive yet. I have two short work experience stints from when I was in school, at Deutsche Bank and PwC, through a Pathways to Banking and Finance programme hosted by LSE for disadvantaged students, but I have not yet done anything relevant in uni. Additionally, I did not take the first year of uni seriously (am yet to resit 6 exams) so have poor academic credentials for the last year, which is an obstacle in applying for spring weeks this year. The idea is that a period in the Navy will grow me professionally and as a person, in terms of leadership, work ethic, attention to detail, pressured decision making and provide an exciting career. Then I am aware that some firms like Goldman have veterans schemes and finance would be a good outlet to transfer these qualities. Such naval experience I imagine would also keep me open for engineering jobs and potentially working at space companies (where aviation experience is highly valued). Some considerations I have are whether I should seek some finance work experience in between uni and applying to the Navy (i.e. a 'gap year') and whether I should look into pursuing further education alongside work should I be offered a position in the Navy, in some quantitative subject (such as postgraduate study in applied physics/quantum algorithms or a qualification in finance) if that would be advantageous in the corporate world. I am also aware that it would be a lengthy commitment to the military, in which salary progression is nothing like the ridiculous figures you see in the world of finance.

It's hard for me to get back into meditation and controlling my stress since sometime my anxiety seems super intense and then I get into a negative feedback loop.

I'm just wondering could this chronic stress and anxiety be causing a lack of morning erections?

I'm a very healthy 26 year old male. I've been trying to abstain from porn and masturbation to help, I also just quit nicotine about 2 weeks ago and I eat a healthy predominately plant based diet. I eat meat occasionally as well so it's a well rounded diet.

The only problems I've been having trouble with is stress/anxiety and in return it's been messing with my sleep. It's been very hard for me to stay asleep past 3-4 hours without waking. 

Is there anything I should check bloodwork wise? Cortisol or prolactin? 

I also go to therapy but it doesn't seem to be helping a bunch, I just feel like I'm venting a lot without much change.

1dsyqpd,university,I could really use some advice,"I need some advice with where to go next

I’m currently 21 years old and I’m a community college student in New England. I’m currently enrolled in an engineering program that will allow me to transfer to a 4 year. I also work at an internship part-time at an engineering firm. But the thing is, I’m not enjoying it anymore. Last semester I was just so depressed from always studying when I got home for hours into the next morning only to barely pass my classes. There were even times when I didn’t have time to sleep and shower (I know, it’s gross) let alone see friends and family. I’ve taken the summer break to readjust my life (workout and exercise more, eat healthier, and trying to reverse this depression with professional help) but I don’t want to go back to school for engineering. Don’t get me wrong, I still want to get a degree, but I feel aimless and I don’t know where to go. Engineering is something I thought I wanted for myself, but after working at my internship, I’ve realized that I don’t want to be at a desk all day doing calculations. Im at a point where I have all my gen eds, minus a class or two, so I can start any other major as at least a sophomore and take the core program classes but I’m stuck on what to choose. I’d stay in engineering because I’ve sunk two years into it but I just can’t handle the stress and depression that came with it. I’ve looked into everything from construction management, to business, to electronic technology. I have a little interest in everything and unfortunately I tend to loose interest in what I do sometimes. Currently, I’m looking into Criminal Justice and a minor in psychology. I’ve always loved the idea of helping and being a part of my community and being a cop seems really cool (I know it’s not a requirement to have a degree to be a cop but I’ve heard that it helps to raise the ranks easier and get a better salary). I also don’t want to be rich, just to make enough where I’m not worrying about money all the time and have the possibility to make more and support a family in the future. I also want to possibly be a political figure in the future (like city council, mayor, governor, senator, rep, or even president?) to further help the community I grew up in. I’m scared that I burned myself out and that I lost my ability to like learning but I hear CJ is an easy major that teaches you a lot about how our society works under law and I feel like that understanding will be very beneficial to my goals. I’d love some advice from people who have graduated from this major or who have had this “aimless feeling”. Thanks in advance! ",2024-07-01 17:28:02,2,0,1,Positive,0.055645904483113774,0,0,2

1dyk48b,stress,ADHD + Stress = not able to fall asleep or stay asleep,"I was diagnosed with ADHD after about 4-5 hours of testing at a clinic near me. I was very open and honest with the psychiatrist, and I was prescribed an Ampheta/Dextro Combo, starting at 10mg. Over two months, my dosage was increased to 20mg. I take one dose between 7-7:30am and another between 12-1pm. I do not take the medication on the weekend unless I need it. The medication has been incredibly beneficial for my life, and I really wish I had sought help sooner.

However, I've recently encountered a significant issue. I didn't have trouble sleeping before, but now I do. I recently went through a breakup, moved, and my schedule changed. I don't consciously think about these changes at night, but I think my mind is staying active instead of winding down. Even with my eyes closed, my brain picks up small noises and doesn't fully shut off.

I spoke to my psychiatrist about the added stress from the breakup affecting my sleep, which was making me feel crazy from the lack of rest. She prescribed me Xanax for a short period to help me get through this phase. I don't want to rely on it long-term as I prefer to handle normal stress without medication. Despite not feeling anxiety or extra stress physically, I'm still struggling with sleep.

I work out daily, walking for 6 hours at my desk on a walking pad or running 5-8 miles as I'm training for a marathon in September. This usually exhausts me enough to sleep soundly, but it's not working anymore. The Xanax isn't helping much anymore it did at first. I take the one 1mg pill it at 10pm but end up staying awake until 12:30am, then waking up at 5:30am and struggling to fall back asleep until around 6:30-7am. This irregular sleep schedule is affecting me.

I suspect that the breakup, change of environment, and possibly the Adderall might be contributing to this issue, but I'm not sure. It'll be a while before I can see my doctor again.

Has anyone experienced something similar or have any suggestions? Maybe I am posting to the wrong subreddit.

And now everything needs to be sorted; sale, donate, pack, keep out for now. The timeline isn't set. Things are variable. Everything is waiting for a job and then move move move... get there fast enough.

185bpkc,stress,3 strategies to cope with stress during life transitions,"Going through a life transition can be stressful and overwhelming, especially if you have multiple responsibilities for family, work, community, and more. Balancing all these aspects while finding time for self-care can be challenging.  
  
To better manage your stress, it is essential to improve your time management. In terms of time allocation, I encourage you to begin by addressing your distractions. Take a moment to reflect on the distractions that may be hindering your progress in life. Identify them and consider how you can let go of these distractions. This becomes particularly crucial during times of significant life changes when your old routines or patterns have been disrupted. Prioritize by focusing on one task at a time. Determine what is most important at the moment and let go of less urgent matters.  
  
The second key strategy is to establish a daily routine for self-care, even if it is as short as 30, 20, or 10 minutes. Dedicate this time to activities that bring you peace and calm, such as reading, journaling, nature walks, yoga, or meditation. Consistently follow this routine daily to recharge. Taking breaks and slowing down can enhance long-term efficiency and productivity.  
  
**Stress is not solely a result of our actions; it is also influenced by our thoughts. Overthinking can lead to stress and feeling overwhelmed. One effective method to reduce stress is to reframe your thoughts and let go of overthinking.** Practice mindfulness by focusing on the present moment, avoiding worries about the future, or dwelling on the past. When you catch yourself contemplating the past or future, pause, become aware of those thoughts, and redirect your focus to the present moment. Being mindful of everything around you and expressing gratitude.  
  
**Stress can be a signal that it’s time to let go — let go of distractions, unimportant matters, and negative thoughts. By releasing these attachments, you create space for your mind to rest and quiet down, breaking free from the captivity of stress.** Letting go makes you feel lighter and more liberated.

I go to an ivy league and I was an awesome student in high school. But truthfully, I'm overwhelmed by my particular college because it is in one of the most dangerous cities, it's always rainy/cold, the people are often genuinely bad human beings (go figures for excessively rich people), and my classes are rigorous but in a way where our grading curves are intentionally low (like one of my professors would regrade and give us lower grades which is not allowed).

In summary, I think it might be good for me to switch schools but I'm not really sure what to do. My credits largely won't transfer over because I'm a STEM major and our degree plan isn't similar to other schools (my particular major is neuroscience so it's not universally offered either). If you were in my situation, would you just rough out the rest of your degree or completely switch life paths and start over? My big issue with this year is that I have a required thesis, have ADHD (and will likely have to share a room), and tuition increased significantly (it will be double what it has been previously).

I'm worried because on my college's bookstore it is almost 300 dollars, while on McGraw Hill it is almost 200. I have however seen versions much cheaper ranging from 7 to 40 dollars.

 This is a staggering difference. These prices are on Amazon, Chegg, and Abebooks. They have the same ISBNS and are the same edition. They specifically say connect Access Card 720 days. And the credible ones have good reviews.

This all seems pretty credible, but it seems too good to be true. All the people at the college I've talked to have said to buy them from their bookstore or McGraw Hill, including the teacher. 

How could there be such a jump in price? Am I overthinking it? Should I just try and buy this quickly?",2024-08-13 22:20:56,1,2,1,Positive,0.2641025641025641,0,0,2

1clsac3,academia,Losing passion about academia ,"I'm an academic in the UK. I've always had a passion for academia. I enjoy research and I like teaching and connecting with energetic excited people that are eager to learn and make a difference in the world.

But I've been feeling quite down recently about work. So I just want to vent a little and read about similar experiences and how they developed, and I'll particularly appreciate any advice or thoughts that would help. 

So I did my PhD in Germany. I hated living in Germany but the academic community I was part of was so much fun. Everyone was excited, coming up with crazy ideas, everyone collaborated, bachelor and master students produced excellent work and sort of brought my ideas to reality which I'd then do further analysis on and write papers on with the students. It was quite stressful though because I had a <4-year scholarship and typically people take longer in their PhDs in Germany. Competition was fierce. 

Then I moved to the UK and became a lecturer here. I love the city I'm in and the university was quite supportive especially in the beginning. I got a lot of grants, recruited a lot of good PhD students. My publications and grants portfolio are growing at a steady rate. But I lost something.. I think I lost the connection to fellow PhD students. Collaborations with my fellow academics are not the same. Maybe it's the people or maybe it's just the type of collaboration (because now we collaborate by co supervising students rather than directly). My time is mostly managing students, grants, and finding time in between to ""get teaching out of the way"". I am organizing a big conference because I enjoy this more than being on program committees (I'm in compute science so conferences are a bit deal), but it's more stress that it is fun. 

I also recently got a big admin role in our department. It has some rewarding aspects but most of the time is spent doing shit work like approving leaves, revising processes for admissions and scholarships, fixing mistakes by incompetent admin staff. 

I wish I can sit and think of creative ideas to solve interesting problems like before. I wish I can do that instead of having to worry about my next grant application, which is likely in a topic that can attract funding rather than a topic that I'm passionate about. I wish I can afford to do the stuff I ask my PhD students to do, and write papers, and review papers. But as an academic at my stage, that would be an unwise use of my time and I'm expected to instead get grants to supervise people do these things. 

I don't feel intellectually stimulated anymore and I don't feel excited about research anymore. I used to be the person that's excited for Monday to get back to work. Now I'm researching early retirement 😂 

Has any one experienced the same? Is this what a mid life crises is for academics 😂? Any advice or thoughts that would help?

I have not been very physically fit, I am a bit on the overweight side becau of my metabolic rate but I have always kept it in check with some physical activities. Also, I have had issues with self control & procrastination. When I was young I had a lot lf self control but over the years it reduced.

On the bad side, I have watched porn for a lot of years and had people pleasing tendencies. But I have completely stopped it since around 6 - 8 months and I am proud of that achievement. I also go to gym daily and work out.


I have always been anxious and stressed usually worrying about what will happen in the future and how will I do X or handle Y or do Z if something goes wrong. And this used to cause me a lot of pain and made me procrastinate and indecessive.

Around 6 months ago I had severe case of this anxiety when I was on call and I didn't know everything about the system and didn't know what to do. I panicked a lot and had a lot of sleepless nights. It was bery bad and that caused something to burst in my head. Maybe that's a panick attack though I am not too sure. Since then I have had this weird sensation behind my forehead at the centre of my eye brows and whenever I try to focus.

I have tried reducing stress a lot and taking actions to aovid stresses. But this pain during focus time or alert time I experience, I don't know and causes problems with me on my job. 

I wanted to know if there was anyone that that has seen something like this before ? And any remedies for this ? Would really appreciate help. Thank you.

Note I am also in contact with a psychiatrist and his prescribed medicines have helped me but this specification sensation he doesn't understand.",2024-06-02 11:04:27,1,4,1,Negative,-0.09411764705882353,0,0,0

I'm a transfer student and I am living on an off-campus apartment for six months now. I have gone to two parties that two separate people held and some people were cool with me hanging out after the wee hours. I tried getting into a getty party that someone was holding (pretty much a get together with friends). The problem was that after 15 minutes, one his friends told me I had to leave because he felt uncomfortable with me being there. I was confused by this because I had gone to previous gettys and I did not get kicked out before.

The thing is is that I am shy, antisocial and heavily introverted. But, I am not uncomfortable surrounding myself with alcohol and weed that everyone else usually does. I was able to talk to one his other friends and he explained to me that I should try to get to know him a bit more since I am one of those that is considered ""chill"" in these parties/getty's. The issue is that I have bad social anxiety and I'm the type of person to not share that many personal things about me. I would like to get to know him a bit more, but at the same time, I don't want to constantly keep getting kicked out because my goal is to make new friends (as I am new to the city and college that I am going to).

I am currently a research assistant for a dissertation study at Fielding Graduate University conducted by Julia Catlin, Ph.D Candidate in Clinical Psychology. The study is titled **“Exploring the Effects of Secure Base Script Knowledge and Reflective Functioning on Rejection Sensitivity in Adults.”**

The study involves two parts: 1) **completion of a 15-20-minute background questionnaire** and 2) **a** **20–30-minute virtual interview** with a research assistant. The interview will consist of a storytelling exercise and asking questions that reflect on past events of your life.

# Inclusion criteria: 

* 18+ years old
* In a Relationship
* English Fluency
* Willing to do a two-part study, including a brief interview and online background questionnaire
* Military, Long-Distance Relationships, 2SLGBTQIIA+, and ENM/Poly all encouraged to participate.

One of the benefits of this study as a participant is to share and reflect on their experiences to develop a greater awareness of their relationships with others. The storytelling exercise utilizes the participant's creativity, which many find enjoyable! Another benefit of the study is contributing to research that could help develop interventions for people who are struggling with problems in their relationships, anxiety, and emotional reactivity.

The confidentiality of each participant will be maintained through the use of pseudonyms, removal of identifiable information from transcripts, and all study materials will be stored in locked and password-protected spaces. Participation is voluntary, and participants may withdraw from the study at any time without consequence.

I have done blood tests, sleep apnea tests, blood pressure tests (high every other time i test), testosterone tests, neurological tests and so on (no brain scan), been to the eye-doctor to test vision (they said eye musculature were strained) which i find weird since it was 9am. I haven't woken up feeling rested in these two years, and i don't remember having a pleasant feeling in my body, but I wouldn't say that I'm overly depressed, just accustomed to this awful feeling that comes and goes and at this point i have a hard time imagining that this is all in my head. Been to the doctors and psychiatrists several times but blood tests and meditation are usually what they offer as a solution. Been trying to find obvious connection to what makes it worse, but can't seem to pinpoint anything specific. Would like to make a life change such as changing jobs, but it is very difficult as i'm not functioning at normal capacity and haven't been for a long time. This whole ordeal also increases my social anxiety by a lot, since meeting people while feeling like i have a bad drug trip is not very comfortable.   
  
I was wondering if anybody has any experience with this?

1ekgttx,careeradvice,"Want to Leave Current Job after 2 months, Keep on Resume or Not while Applying?","I’m looking for advice with my resume while applying for jobs. It’s been about four months since I left my previous job which was remote (laid off due to entire dept being shutdown), and I’ve been at my current, in-person job for just under two months. I’m now applying for remote job positions, and I’m wondering whether to include my current job on my resume.

My current job is highly relevant to the roles I’m applying for; in fact one job posting i'm really interested in is basically my current job but 100% remote. I have some relevant experience in another previous job but nothing like my current job. So, should I keep imy current job on my resume while applying due to its relevance, or would it be better to leave it off to avoid showing that I’m looking to leave after only 2 months? I’m concerned that leaving it off might create a four-month gap since my last job, but I’m also worried about how a really short job tenure might be a red flag to a hiring manager.

I'm open to staying here and growing within the company, but I also want to make sure I have the skills and experience needed to pursue other opportunities if necessary.

1bhsapt,stress,Moving Aches and Pains ,"Male/37/14.5st

Never had health or any other form of anxiety before but I keep being told this is what's causing my problems, I'm just finding  it hard to believe I suppose

All started 3 weeks ago when I found a 20p sized spot of blood when wiping. This freaked me out and went to A&E, Dr said he thinks he can see a haemorrhoid and it was probably that. Had a bit of tingling down there for 2 days as well. Didnt really reassure me though, I need more than ""think"" when I see blood. Since then, I've had pain in my groin, pain in my left testicle and a slight tingling when going for a wee, went to the GP for these symptoms and he ""thinks"" he can feel a vericolle or whatever it's called, got an ultrasound next month. Those Aches/Pains have since gone btw 

Now for the past 2 weeks I seem to be having pain all over my abdomen and chest, started off with me feeling my heart racing and beating out my chest, thought I was having a heart attack if I'm honest! Then it was an ache down my left from below my rib cage to my belly button, felt tight like something inside me was stretched out too much, then had aches down my left flank, then to my left groin and pelvic area, LLQ area mainly, hip bone feels tender on both sides, got the same feeling in my LRQ area today and slight tenderness in my upper middle abdomen. None of these symptoms I'd said are agony pain, maybe a 3-4 out of 10. They are normally constant but that might be because I can't take my mind off of what it is that's causing it. Last couple mornings I've woke up clammy and my stomach growling, did the same after breakfast this morning too actually. 

So after all that, I guess my question is, can anxiety cause pain that shifts constantly? The pain only seems to be in a certain area for a few days then moves to somewhere else. 

I'm constantly on Google trying to figure this out, I've had 2 poo tests, 2 blood tests and 1 urine test, all have come back negative for whatever they have been testing for apart from 1 poo test which I'm waiting results for, there was a bit of mucus when I seen the blood so that test is still yet to come back. GP has ordered another poo test to look for bacteria in my stomach, collecting that today. You'd think the anxiety would be gone with all the negative tests but I can't help think something is being missed. I really want an ultrasound but I don't think I'll be given one

1ekz80j,careeradvice,Can you help me?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 21-year-old man struggling to settle on a career choice. I’ve tried college but am awful at academics. I completed 1 math and 1 English course BARELY, in the 4 years of attempting community college. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I could complete a certificate program if I have my heart set on something.

The only things that interest me right now are:

	1.	Coming up with solutions to problems.
	2.	Creating and improving.
	3.	Investigation.
	4.	Strong interest in spirituality and the mind.

After stating my interests, I want to share that for some reason I have this big mentality of prioritizing my well-being. I fear I will work too much and not be able to enjoy my life. In my eyes, life isn’t worth living if it isn’t enjoyable. I have severe anxiety and OCD. My mental health is not the best right now, especially dealing with this tough situation. I’m not somebody who needs expensive things to be happy. I can be very happy making 70-80k a year. As I am very independent and don’t even have an interest in owning a big house with more than one floor. I am all for a simple lifestyle.

As for family wants, I don’t see myself having a family of my own. I am a homosexual and only see myself with a husband at the most (obviously a few dogs along the way, lol). Sorry, I really am rambling, but I want to put everything on the table to get the most accurate feedback.

It would greatly help me if anyone is willing to share their thoughts on this post. Or if you think similarly to me and could share some thoughts, I would really appreciate that!",2024-08-05 21:08:08,2,0,1,Positive,0.20938135938135935,0,0,2

Ever since I was young, she's always been selfish and self-centred. As we aged, we kinda got along better but our current relationship is rlly bad. 

I've also fallen out of a pretty long friendship. I found out she's been talking bad abt me and telling ppl lies behind my back.

What is your experience with this and what are the limitations on the tests? My mom says that a lot of the testing will be on concepts and not so much on simple math so it should be fine but I wasn't sure.

1csdp2w,academia,Feeling Depressed during my Thesis (Double Degree)," I'm reaching out for help regarding my current situation as a master's student doing my thesis in Japan. I joined a double degree program between my home university and a Japanese university, and I’m supposed to complete my thesis here.

The issue is that it feels like I have to do everything on my own. My supervisor here is not supportive and doesn’t have expertise in my field. I’ve struggled a lot with learning and conducting experiments because there are so many deadlines, presentations, and other demands. Despite being a master's student, my professor expects me to do original research and even publish a paper to graduate from his lab. And it works completely different in my home university.

I joined this program thinking it would be a great opportunity to work in a new field, to learn new things with the right support. However, I ended up facing all these problems. Additionally, I was supposed to collaborate with a big company, but I’ve already changed supervisors four times (because they moved to other companies) in almost two years, and none of them have been very supportive as they are not experts in the field either.

This situation is really demotivating. I started with a lot of enthusiasm and have been pushing through for 1.5 years despite all the issues. There were many times I considered dropping out. Now, with only 4 months left (3 months before I’m supposed to graduate), I’m struggling to find the motivation to continue. I also feel like my supervisor is becoming less and less supportive because I didn't match his requirements.
I didn’t join this program just for the degree, but for the experience and learning opportunities, yet I’ve encountered so many problems.

Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice on how to deal with this? Any tips and honest opinion would be greatly appreciated.

1d1bdia,stress,"Random panic, always feels the need to be doing something in moments of rest?","Hello everyone, looking for some advice as to have to cope with stress more efficiently.
I am a young woman who is balancing between a full-time job and a part-time job, I’m constantly financially stressed, and have some health issues that contribute to not feeling good half of the time, and given the amount of work I must do to keep myself afloat I am not allowed to much time to rest.

I am currently taking the time and looking for a more sustainable job so that I can live my life, not just work through it. With me making these changes and putting forth effort to have some time for myself, I find that when I have moments of nothing to do, I just feel overwhelmed.

Legitimately, I could work on a hobby of mine, or do something fun but it stresses me out to the point where I would just rather lay on the couch and scroll on my phone for some simple dopamine. I want to be better, but even doing anything that I enjoy stresses me out. It’s like it’s too quiet, and I keep myself busy with things that need to be done, or clean so that I can avoid doing nothing.

Another thing that I’ve noticed, is that when I’m in a peaceful environment we’re nothing could possibly go wrong, my body goes into panic mode. Just recently I took the time and money to give myself a nice haircut, normally I cut it myself.

Anyways, when I was on the chair, getting a really nice scalp massage and closing my eyes, I just felt anxious. I get these moments where I feel like I have to fight my body from lurching up from the chair and running out of the whole place. It’s like I imagine it happening in my mind and I just going to full panic mode even though I know I’m safe.

It hasn’t inhibited my life too much, however the thoughts are unpleasant. I am able to cope and call myself down, however I just get confused as to why my body reacts the way that it does.",2024-05-26 21:14:05,7,10,1,Positive,0.13729721456994182,0,0,2

1cvm98b,university,Should I transfer or stay at my current uni? ,"Last spring I applied to my then dream uni and got rejected (because of problems with my documents). The only back up I had was my local university.  
The first semester was a bit hell-ish but the second semester has been going a lot better (two of three lectures and their proseminars go quite well, I daresay; I made some friends; I like my professors.) The only major problem is that I'm commuting around 1 and a half hours one way, which is very tiring and not ideal for social activities like going out, etc.

Now the problem is, I **re-applied** to the other uni and **got** **accepted** this time. The uni is

* quite well-known
* a bit prestigious
* has a lot of international connection (and many, many international students)
* and is also one of the best unis around (in Europe at least).

If the last few months had been awful, it would be really clear decision to get out of the hell-hole. But the last 2,3 months were pleasant.

What also plays into my decision, is the fact that some of my friends are likely to change majors, or start doing half pace.

And I'm worried that if I stay, just for the sake of these people and my professors, I missed the chance to experience a very social and positive experience at the other uni (which is also known for its student life)  
I'm just generally worried; I'd be moving out of the house I lived my whole life in with my parents, I'd be going to another country, with a different language and culture - I'm afraid that I won't fit in and be friendless (I have some social anxiety too).

Last year this time I would have jumped at this opprtunity without second thought really, but things have changed.  
Here's a little list, with the arguments that came to me the fastest.

|very good uni|hasn't got my (Linear) Algebra professor|
|social life, new start|not entirely convinced of the programme structure|
|more independency|my current friends aren't there|

1cryil7,academia,Shaming of younger research students who have to seek paid employment away from research ,"I have been working as a research assistant/student with a research team for over 2 years now. For the first year, I was a paid student through my university's internship program during my undergrad degree. The other half year, I was paid through and undergrad/new-grad program during the summer.

I still ""work"" with the research team. However, I am not being paid and have not been paid for about a half of a year. I have asked my PI if they would be open to paying me. However, they have told me that our research team does not have the money and that they cannot afford to pay anyone else. To my knowledge, they pay around 5 people. 

I've had the honour of leading many projects, preparing abstracts/papers and delivering presentations - privelegdes that many undergrads and recent grad are not afforded. I still have many responsibilities on the team and in many ways I work as a research analyst (e.g. leading projects, REB work, contracts, paper writing, etc). I know this is often the norm in academic research nowadays. 

I bring this all up because I mentioned to my PI that I will have to step away from my responsibilities on their team to find another position that pays me. I will be starting graduate school in the fall, which is quite expensive. I will also need to find a place to live near my graduate school for at least the first year.

My PI did not react well to this. They told me that if I was truly committed to this work and this research, I would stay and maintain my workload on their team. I have tried to be as kind as diplomatic as possible in stating that above all else, I need to make enough money to survive. I am currently not doing that. For now, that is fine because I do not have as many financial responsibilities. However, that will change by September.

I'm writing all this because I want to know if I am being unreasonable for wanting to seek employment elsewhere. They are obviously very experienced and I value their opinion. They are true that I will lose some opportunities by stepping back from their team. However, part of me feels they are a little out of touch of the current financial stresses facing young people today - especially young STEM researchers who are expected to be satisfied with surviving off of volunteer research positions right out of undergrad. I will be living in a very expensive city and will be entering an expensive graduate program. 

I want to know if other young researchers have faced this same pressure/shaming to stay in non-paying/volunteer research positions instead of paid positions elsewhere - whether it is in a related field or not. 

I would love to hear everyone's thoughts, though. Regardless of level of experience :) ",2024-05-14 17:55:21,51,32,1,Positive,0.1103980278980279,0,0,2

During a recent medical check-up, I discovered that I have an arrhythmia, and the doctor also mentioned that my stress levels are quite high. This inspired our team, specializing in machine learning, to develop an iOS app that can measure heart rate, HRV, and other vital signs using image recognition technology. The app aims to detect and monitor conditions like arrhythmia and high stress.

We believe that measurements taken with a smartwatch, such as the Apple Watch, would be more accurate. Therefore, we are especially interested in hearing from Apple Watch users about your experiences and needs.We will carefully read and consider every response. Here is a format you can follow for your reply, or you can answer freely:

1. Your age
2. The health metrics you are most concerned about

It's currently really cold outside and while I do feel quite cold with a hoodie, everybody is cold while wearing a jacket and I get used to the cold. 

I went to the doctor on Thursday and they told me it's just anxiety and stress and that I should change my lifestyle, but it's odd because it feels like it's gotten worst. My head also feels like part of it is empty, or missing, or just isn't there.

1ctqqok,stress,Stress causing hallucination in elderly?,"Hi everyone 

I’m confused because I have a family member that is experiencing hallucinations and agitation out of no where. 

I raised concerns about that plus other things such as hair loss to the doctor. The doctor keeps reporting memory loss concerns, but memory loss is not an issue in my opinion. The family member’s memory is good and better than some younger kids…shoot even mine.

It’s the hallucination that’s the concern.

The refuse to consider the meds being the causes of that but agreed that the med management is a little messy currently. 

I contacted the pharmacist where we picked the meds up at and they review her prescription history on a quick phone call and think it can be a result of low sugar maybe, but says the meds in question wouldn’t cause that.

It confuses me because I looked up the meds in question and they have side effects of what I’m complaining about online.

I’m trying to figure out what to do. My hope was to get the medical team on the same page so we can stop the meds, monitor, test, and analyze from their. That way we can manage the meds a little better and slowly add things back as needed and safely.

I don’t understand why everyone is saying there’s no side effects or not these side effects as the side effects in question pops up on the first page of Google.

What can I do? The medical team didn’t see anything that stands out on the mri but is calling the issue maybe dementia due to a memory loss test that I believe the family member did good in. I was there. It was just calculations that were not good. 

I’m going to connect with a neurologist next, but I just don’t want to be quick to call something dementia when it’s might be due to medication.

It’s like they just want to give meds that have similar effects to these other diagnoses or disorders and say that person has X and when it gets worse it’s not due to X but truly secretly due to the meds.

I’m just hoping to connect and learn from others here in hopes with making the next best steps to help with what’s happening.

Meds in question:
Mirtazapine
Atorvastatin
Diabetic medication- one was recently stopped which I thought was the cause of the hallucinations but they started the family memeber on mirtazapine the same week where things got worst.

I have two siblings,  one is helping all they can but has a terminally ill spouse,  the other has helped some, but generally just makes excuses and puts it off on me (or has their spouse text me to tell me to leave our parent in the facility and if something goes wrong they will call).

I'm 18 I just graduated high school and well my grades were not as great as I expected them to be hence led me to being rejected from my dream school UCL.

So I have a few options but they all lead me to different career paths. TBH idk what I want to do or be in terms of career, I have so many interests but I also lack a lot of skills. I just want some advice now. In no particular order.

1. I got an offer from KCL for global health where I can do 3 different streams. 

The thing is job prospects after this degree are very bleak. I will mostly have to do a masters in either finance, law or pharmacy after this. Even after masters pay won't be great. An alternative option is to medicine after this course. I have been interested in medicine but always hated the lifestyle of medicine I don't think I can handle the pressure but I also don't know. 

This course is only 3 years so I can save time and money. KCL is a great school and being in London the location is pretty good but due to the recession, I might suffer with the cost of living and jobs. 

  
2. I've applied for a foundation year at kcl for engineering and maths but haven't got in yet. (i feel like i might  get in but idk)

I recently only found out I love the jobs related to engineering not only cause of the pay but also the versitility of it and the impact it can make. I've always been intrested in sustainability and medicine and by doing chemical engineering or biomedical engineering I could probably persue my intrest. The hours, work load and pay is rly good but I suck at math like sooo bad. I have liked the idea of engineering but since I was shitty at math my teachers told me not to do physics/chem in high school. So I currently have no foundation in chem/physics or math that is required for UK engineering. The pro of this is I have 90% guaranteed admission into KCL for biomedical engineering and also have a chance of reapplying to UCL. But like I said before I suck at math and haven't done it in a while so I'm scared about how I will cope and don't want to waste a year. 

3. Go to Australia for biotechnology 

I got into a great school in australia UNSW for biotechnology it is 4 years but I'm scared that I wouldn't like it there. Just going through their reddit page scares me everyone says it's hard in terms of academics and also social life and finding friends. From what ive heard UNSW is not that recognised as much as kcl or ucl and jobs might be hard abroad. IDK where i want to work so i'm just so unsure. UNSW also has a lot of options for study abroad which i love as it was initially a dream of mine to study in the states but i was rejected from most schools i wanted to go and got into the schools which was tooo expensive and just wasn't worth the investment. Also people have transfered to us unis from unsw which is nice as it's impossible to transfer from the uk to the us. 



  
also this is just a big rant sorry if i sound ungrateful i am i just dont want to make the wrong decison and i want a 3rd party to weigh in on this cause everyone ik is giving differing opinions so yes please send help.

I'm going to the US to study for my PhD in engineering this fall, and a newly hired assistant professor had asked me if I'm interested in joining his lab. His research area aligns closely with my interests and experience, and his work is also highly relevant to modern technology trends, which makes this opportunity particularly exciting for me.

However, there are some concerns I have about choosing a new professor. Being new to the role, he doesn’t have older students in his group whom I could turn to for guidance or advice, and he want only one PhD student for his first year, so I wouldn't have anyone other than the professor to discuss with. Additionally, as an ambitious academic just starting out, he might expect me to work very hard to meet high standards. I’ve read his published papers, and they are very impressive that I’m worried about whether I can achieve the same level of quality in my research. (It seems that he only wants to publish in journals with impact factor of 20+)

An important factor in my decision is that I currently have no interest in pursuing a career in academia. My goal is to find a job in the industry after completing my PhD. Would choosing a new professor as my advisor impact my chances in the industry?

As an international student, the choice of advisor is particularly important to me, as the status of my visa is essentially in the hands of my advisor. I’d greatly appreciate any advice.

Thanks in advance for your help!",2024-06-05 18:08:59,2,18,1,Positive,0.1794592476489028,0,0,2
1ese04y,careeradvice,Dumb question: what is this job called,"I have kind of lucked into a job that I really love. Not so much because of the work or the people, but because of the excellence life balance and the lack of imposter syndrome I feel, which nearly broke me in my last job. I work for an event management company and help them find and implement software to help run their events. This includes everything from managing the development of their home grown registration system, to finding solutions to book onsite meeting rooms, and everything in between. The company is not in the tech sector, but I came from the tech sector, so I guess I'm more savvy on what to use and everyone seems happy. I have pretty much full autonomy, am an IC but still work with multiple departments, and am never overwhelmed with work. While I'm happy, the company cut some of our events this year so I'm worried the writing is on the wall and want to start looking, if for nothing else than to have some interview practice for when and if they start to do layoffs. 

The problem is I don't know what this job is called. Yes I know that's dumb. What would the title be for someone that finds external software solutions for operational problems, and then implements those solutions? What kind of experience is required for that role? Operations Manager? I've looked at those jobs most involve managing other people, which I do not want to do. 

  
\*\*\* Not sure if this is relevant buy my background is in product management. And I fully believed that would be my career but I just don't have it in me. I don't care about the different PM philosophies and methods, I don't care about the different organizational principles, and all the other stuff that comes with it. It started to feel like a big circle jerk to me. I just wanted to ideate, build and ship. ",2024-08-14 21:58:56,1,0,1,Positive,0.18913043478260877,0,0,2

1eicofj,academia,No work for me to do in my PhD lab - advice?,"Hi,

I am a rising 2nd year PhD student in the USA at a top 5 institution for my topic. I switched advisors in April because I wasn't interested in the topic I was initially admitted for.

Since May, I began working with another professor and his work much better aligns with my research. This professor is a great person (very kind and emotionally intelligent), but so far not a great mentor. The issue is that all he is giving me to do is reading. I have collected no data this summer. I've asked the lab manager if there is anything in the lab I can help with and I've been told no.

Every time I meet with this professor, he tells me to read more. I have been reading all summer and I am bored out of my mind and very frustrated. This professor only has one project open that does not have grad students working on it, so I expressed interest in working on this project. But I was told by the lab manager that I can't do lab work yet because the instrument is not ready to measure what I need, so he gave me an instruction manual to read.

I've also pitched new ideas to my professor and he says it is too far outside his research area (he is somewhat old is probably is not very open to expanding his research).

  
A masters degree is built into my PhD. So I have to write a masters paper by March 2025 and defend it. I'm worried that I won't be able to collect data by then to hit the masters milestone. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",2024-08-02 15:16:51,0,5,1,Positive,0.15026515151515152,0,0,2

1dd6mss,university,how to break up with uni friends ,"
i’ve been living in university for almost 2 years and i’ve had the same friendship group the entire time and no other friends but them during that time period, but i dropped out of uni and am moving back home (3 hours away) and i want to stop being friends with at least 4 of them but i dont know how to go about it

for context, during first year we did not live together, and in second year we all do 

throughout our friendship, i’d noticed that whenever i’d have conversations with these 4 people i was always the one initiating it including checking up on them before we lived together (first year) and during the summer when we were all at home. when i noticed this i stopped messaging first and none of them have messaged me first since to even ask how i am in the last year at all, including whilst we’ve been living together and also when i’d told them my mum was saying she was going to kick me out the house last year (she didnt im ok, but during the time i really wasnt) and including the time when i told them i was dropping out and i was very depressed and literally stopped hanging out at all for about 2 weeks which is definitely out of character for me - the only one who messaged was not one of those 4



the same goes for plans within the entire group - only a handful of plans were made by any of them, and majority were by me. i know you're probably thinking why did i keep making plans then, but i honestly only really noticed it at the beginning of this year and by that point i knew i was going to drop out, and they were my only friends and if i didn't hang out with them the rest of the time i was at uni (i had to stay till the end of the year or i'd have issues with paying back student finance) i'd just continue bedrotting and even more depressed than i already was and my anxiety would be worse too

  
i think the icing on the cake to me was the fact that i'm leaving in two days and not a single one of them have said goodbye. some of them have already gone home and won't be coming back till after i leave, and yet have still made 0 effort to see me or talk to me before i go. people still talk in our group chat and joke and message there, and i only even see anyone if we bump into each other in the kitchen but other than that none of said goodbye at all 

  
i saw one girl the day before she was leaving to go home and she didn't say goodbye to me, she left me a card outside my door which was nice but i honestly think it was because i gave her a card a few weeks ago to say goodbye, but i dont understand why she couldn't give me the card to my face when she saw me and say goodbye in real life. i had given her my card in real life to her face and so i'd expect her to do the same, especially since she literally saw me the evening before

  
i'm leaving in a couple of days and i don't want to visit them after i leave because i don't. think they're my real friends but i dont know what is a healthy or mature way that isn't mean to go around saying this to them or letting them know how i feel. so help!!!",2024-06-11 05:31:39,2,5,1,Positive,0.07265957566738818,0,0,2
17k3pmo,stress,Dealing with college stress makes me suicidal,"I have little reason to be depressed but I am anyway. I have a lot of friends who I hang out and have fun with regularly, I have family members I deeply love and care about, I have interests and hobbies, but when I’m alone I want to end it.

I think a lot of it stems from the fact that I’m extremely stressed and anxious every day, and I feel like an imposter. I feel like my life has no direction or purpose anymore. None of my interests and hobbies translate to a stable career, so when I chose my college major I just chose English since it’s my favorite subject. But I have no plan after college, I don’t want to be a teacher and idk what else I can do. I don’t have a good financial situation to fall back on so idk how I’ll ever repay all my loans.

The worry I feel about my future is compounded by the stress and anxiety of my performance in school. I used to be smart and always at the top of my class, but the longer Im in college, the worse I become. It’s to the point where I’m barely going to graduate next semester even though I’m already a senior. I could never tell my friends about this, they’re all extremely smart and productive, but thinking about the event in which I fail to graduate on time and have to watch all my friends walk across the stage without me just makes me want to kill myself before spring to avoid going through that.

I don’t always want to die, but I find suicide to be really tempting on most days. I feel like an imposter in every aspect of my life, I genuinely don’t deserve success, and everything would be so much easier if I just cut my life short now instead of trying to navigate life after college",2023-10-30 21:06:13,5,9,1,Positive,0.11155202821869487,0,0,2

My boss went out of her way to make the pay and the terms of FT Position would be something that I would stay for and still within range of what she could offer - she even mentioned wanting to make it whatever it would need to be so I wouldn't want to leave in summer's busy time and in this time we were able to bring two onto join me. We have ""seasons"" and this is our heavy heavy season. 

Unfortunately, I am finally ready to leave and am really excited for the days I can focus on my life and not deal with the major emotional roller coaster I am almost always on with this job. Nothing lined up (other than a small consulting gig) just ready to live my life again and try pursuing some other things I've been wanting to do.

over the past couple of years, i've navigated through a stressful time. i was balancing jobs, processing a painful breakup, and dealing with the shock of my mom’s late-stage cancer diagnosis. even though i seemed fine and was functioning well on the outside (trying my best to bring comfort and hope to the family, etc.), i was emotionally exhausted. to cope, my sister and i began helping each other reframe our thoughts and offering the outside perspectives the other needed. this has allowed us to navigate challenges with clarity without ignoring our own needs and feelings.

however, we realized we couldn’t always be there for one another. so, outside the chemo room, we started to build **Thinking Lens** \[website: thinkinglens.app\], an app to help anyone reframe thoughts for better problem-solving and mental wellbeing. inside the app, you can brain dump your feelings and thoughts and be recommended a set of powerful lenses to view your situation differently. (for example, you may gain the 'self-compassion lens' when you're being too harsh on yourself). going beyond recommendations, it handholds you to apply the perspectives to your situation/story right away.

born out of our own needs to navigate everyday challenges with clarity and wellbeing, we continue to build Thinking Lens with care and intention. it’s now built alongside advisory support from leading clinical and research institutes. it’s also appreciated by several mental health professionals eager to recommend it. we’re now in our private beta and would love to offer some free spots. if you think you can use this app as extra support and give us your honest feedback, please DM me. iOS users will get an install link, while Android users will be among the first to get notified when the Android version is available.

1czxwc4,stress,Stressed about my future. Any advice?,"Hi all,

Sorry for the long text, but please bear with me. I want to introduce myself and share some background on how certain events are affecting me mentally. I am a 26-year-old single male, born in South India, and currently living in the UK with my nuclear and extended family from my dad's side. We have been in the UK for over 15 years. I earned my degree in 2020 and have been working as a software engineer since, earning a good salary and living in London with my family. Life was great after I started working, with good friends and everything going well. In 2021, I attended my cousin's wedding in India. He was 25 at the time, and it made me want to get married soon too. I was 23 then and decided to wait until I turned 25, just like my cousin. My family is culture-oriented, and everyone found their spouse in India through arranged marriages, which I also preferred. Last year, when I turned 25, my parents promised to arrange my marriage by the time I was 26. My dad wanted all our extended family members to attend, but due to COVID-19 restrictions in 2021, only a few of us could go to my cousin's wedding. Other uncles visited India in 2022, but we couldn't afford another trip that soon. In 2023, I asked my dad to find me a spouse so I could get married in 2023 because they went in 2023. He suggested waiting another year since our relatives might not go to India again so soon. I agreed because I wanted all my family members at the wedding. However, my dad didn't start looking for a bride until January 2024, and while he found many potential matches, none worked out due to various reasons. Some matches preferred wedding dates that didn't align with our preferred July/August window, the holiday time in the UK. Now, my dad regrets not starting the search earlier, and I am heartbroken to learn I won't be getting married this year. He knew that it would take a long time to find a suitable spouse. In our South Indian culture, it's customary for both groom's and bride's family to have their own home, which we don't. My mum has been urging my dad to build a house for the last ten years, anticipating the need for my and my sister's weddings. My dad always dismissed the idea, relying on our ancestral home instead. Now, he realizes the importance of having our own house, as some potential brides might have rejected us due to this. Building a house would cost around £50K-60K, and with my dad's reduced income due to health issues, he expects me to contribute. Traditionally, fathers build the house, and sons save for their weddings. I've also been saving for my sister's wedding, knowing my dad can't afford it. She is 21, and we plan to find her a groom soon, meaning there will be two weddings next year with significant costs. I have enough saved for both weddings but not for building a house. This situation is causing me extreme stress, pressure, depression, sadness and have no motivation to do anything, all because my hope that I would get married this has been taken away. I feel overwhelmed and don't know what to do.

1cidofm,academia,THE DIGITAL MANIFESTO: CYBERFEMINISM AROUND THE GLOBE (edited collection) CFP,"Cyberfeminism is a fusion of the term 'cyber', denoting the act of steering, governing, and controlling, and 'feminism', which represents an activist movement dedicated to women's liberation and justice at various levels - local, national, and international. Cyber-feminism aims to bridge the gap between the historical and philosophical traditions of feminism and contemporary feminist initiatives both online and offline. These initiatives focus on the lived experiences and realities of women from diverse backgrounds, including different ages, races, and socioeconomic statuses. The primary objective is to establish feminist politics in the digital sphere and equip women with the necessary skills, knowledge, and solidarity from fellow women across the globe. In spearheading this politicised feminist movement online, cyber-feminists must confront the novel social, cultural, and economic dynamics brought about by information technology, recognising that cyberspace mirrors the gender dynamics and struggles prevalent in the physical world (Wilding, 1998).
Emerging as a powerful tool in challenging traditional gender norms and advocating for women’s rights across the globe, Cyberfeminism movements have become a multifaceted phenomenon that intersects with empowerment, leadership, and activism. By utilising digital platforms, cyberfeminism has provided a medium for women to voice their concerns, share experiences, and mobilise for social change, thereby influencing the gender landscape of different nations and cultures. Moreover, cyberfeminism has also played a crucial role in raising awareness about women’s rights issues, which were previously considered taboo. By utilising online platforms, women have been able to shed light on issues such as domestic violence, sexual harassment, and discrimination. This has sparked public discussion and brought attention to these issues, leading to increased pressure on the authorities to address them.
This edited collection seeks to investigate the influence of cyber-feminism and digital activism in addressing gender inequalities and advocating for women's rights around the globe. Utilising feminist theories, postcolonial studies, and media studies, this collection will study the intersection of gender, technology, and activism within the realm of cyberfeminism.
Proposals from scholars at all stages of their careers on the intersection of Feminism, Media, and Cultural studies will be considered.

Questions to consider (potential topics):

How has cyberfeminism and digital movements reshaped gender discourse, empowered women, and challenged societal norms through digital activism and advocacy?
How has cyberfeminism reshaped gender discourse, empowered women, and challenged societal norms through digital activism and advocacy?
What are the challenges and opportunities for cyberfeminists on a global scale?

My main background is working with children specifically special needs. I got out of that field last year and don’t plan on going back. I did some true digging into what my true interests are.

That’s why I would like to find a career field I can tolerate, not too stressful, that’s financially secure, and where I can be happy and content long term- Where that the income I bring in is stable enough that helps me start my health and wellness career as well on the side.

1dqy198,stress,Stressed Out Financially With Paying A Mortgage In A House I do Not Live In,"

I am wrong for not wanting to make mortgage payments in a house I no longer live? My Mother had lost her job due to the pandemic and it's been difficult for her to find anything since then because all of the jobs she has applied to turn her down due to being overqualified. She asked me to help her pay the mortgage until she is able to find work again, but I am at a crossroads on whether to keep supporting this.

I(29F) have been making payments for the mortgage for over 2 and a half years, but it's reached a point where I am tired of paying for this every month. I've sunk over $30,000.00 dollars and counting over the past 2 years just to the mortgage loan. I don't go out anywhere nor do I live a lavish lifestyle like buying dumb materialistic things. I'm extremely frugal with what I spend my money on so I live beneath my means to afford the mortgage as well as my expenses like rent, food, student loans, etc. My Brother (39M) who also lives with my Mother works a minimum-wage job, so he can't afford to pay the mortgage. He does pay some of the bills such as the cable, internet, and food. However, this is not enough especially because he live's in the house as well and I live in my own place.

My Mom is actively searching for work, but she hasn't gotten any offers yet. She has made the decision to place the house on the market four months ago to relieve me of having to keep helping, but I just feel stressed out all the time worrying about when she will find employment after, paying for the mortgage and  trying to build my own adult life. It's emotionally stressful when someone is entirely dependent on you to keep working just to supporting people who're full fledged adults and I am just starting out my own life.

 I don't have any dependents or a spouse so that makes it less of a burden since it's just me and my boyfriend. Has anyone else faced this decision on how to handle supporting family members that are struggling financially? I don't wan to feel like I'm being taken advantage of either, but I try my best to help.",2024-06-28 23:59:30,3,1,1,Positive,0.053822003822003806,0,0,2

1ekym7x,careeradvice,Are my job responsibilities unrealistic??,"Im a full time content creator for a small family company. Im part of a two-person marketing team. Essentially its just me and my boss. Considering how laid back the owners of the company are and decent my pay is (which is barely enough to cover my monthly rent and groceries), I still think it's a pretty cool opportunity to be doing what I love to do. I went to film school so I'm very knowledgeable when it comes to filming, photography, editing, lighting and dabbling with visual effects. But over the past few years, as social media only seems to change faster every day and reaching outside my age range, I'm beginning to feel like I'm pretty underpaid for the amount of work I have to do and/or have been reeled into. It's already very taxing to manage equipment, video files, project files, and juggling the content output for all sorts of platforms while I'm simultaneously trying to create it. On top of all this, I'm beginning to feel the pressure from my superiors for me to manage social media; which includes over 3 channels to try and increase engagement each month and it looks like we'll be trying to expand into TikTok (ugh).

My question is this: is it realistic to be a full time content creator, editor, curator, AND social media manager (which essentially includes scheduling, copy writing, strategizing, publishing, and constant engagement of social media channels)? The company is very touchy about what is published most of the time because of hight-rate product turn around and claim sensitivities. So even if I'm ahead of the curve in my work, I'm bottle necked by the approval process of my marketing manager who puts on too much on their plate.

The marketing department is pretty fragmented because of this. And the work I'm doing today is normally something an agency or outside company would be hired to complete with a whole team. I also haven't mentioned that I'm in charge of many internal company-culture messaging because I'm bilingual and HR managers have come and gone over 3 times since I was hired. I've also asked for a raise and was almost fired. I don't have an official desk in my equipment-filled office I crammed a studio set up in and my tiny desk next to. For the first three years I used my own camera and lighting. I use my own phone for work and only work one day from home after I had to fight for it because I'm more productive in a comfortable environment.

I've thought about throwing in the towel and trying to do my own business but I'm deathly afraid of the law-involved paperwork, contracts, rates, and public-facing elements. The safety of paychecks has me locked in. All of this for hardly 60 a year.

Thanks for reading.  Part of this is a vent. The other part is to see if I'm just crazy, lazy, or have the right to feel burned out and pissed. Btw, my official job title is ""Marketing Assistant."" 🙄",2024-08-05 20:43:40,1,10,1,Positive,0.11105121293800539,0,0,2

1cpep1y,academia,Struggling with Productivity in Academia,"Hey everyone,

I need to get some perspective on the usual productivity level working in academia. I’m really struggling with all the pressure and deadlines. Writing papers and grant proposals, analyzing data, preparing for conferences, supervising students and research assistants, having meetings, reading new articles… it’s just a lot.

I’m working full-time as a postdoc and I actually have a lot of freedom allocating my time. But then I always feel like there’s never enough time. I’m constantly feeling anxious and stressed. I push myself to be productive for 8 hours a day, sometimes even more, but it’s really hard for me to get that going. I always feel drained and tired after a work day. I don’t know how others can do that.

When I’m working on a paper for let’s say 3 or 4 hours, I could basically end the day, maybe answer two or three more emails or get some minor administrative stuff done. But then I feel like I’m not productive enough and getting too much behind. Is that normal?

I’m wondering if I’m in the middle of a burnout or maybe I’m just not smart enough for this job. How many hours a day are you doing ‘deep work’ with deep focus etc.? Are my expectations for myself too high?

Thanks in advance for any insights or advice!",2024-05-11 10:46:07,23,7,1,Positive,0.028154526632787502,1,0,2

1dzalka,academia,Emailing/Connecting with Professors/PI/Post Docs/Grad Students,"Hi everyone!

I have been thinking about sending emails to thank my Professor, PI and the research team for their help, and I am not sure if it is too late for that (it's been almost a month since I graduated).

To give some background info, I joined a research lab since Sophomore year and as an introvert, I feel like it was hard to get close with everyone for the past 2 years. I tried to get close to the Post-Docs and Graduate students but it was difficult to connect with them, I feel like there was a barrier when I tried to talk to them. Every time we talked it was mainly research-related and I wanted to get to know them better like hobbies, etc. As for my PI, I saw him twice in-person but for the majority of the time it was on Zoom. I do want to ask him for a letter of rec but unsure if he knows me well enough, he is a pretty well-known scientist and often busy/occupied with another lab.

Aside from the research lab, there is a Professor that I wanted to connect after graduating. I attended classes (a series for my major, plus lab) taught by her for about 2 years. I also LA'd (Learning Assistant) for her lab class during my last term of Senior year but I have not heard back from her for 2 weeks. I hope she isn't ghosting me because I need a LOR from her :((

Please help, any advice would be appreciated. Is it too late to send them emails? I know I should've done it earlier but I get emailing anxiety and procrastinated in writing the emails until now. If so, should I do it individually? Thank you!",2024-07-09 19:04:35,2,3,1,Negative,-0.0860294117647059,0,0,0

1eon31n,stress,How to deal with stress without weed?,"
I'm in a really transitional period of my life. My girlfriend is 5 months pregnant, I just broke the lease on my apartment and moved in with my girlfriends mother, I just bought a new car, and I'm starting a new job on Monday. A lot of things are changing very rapidly.

It makes sense that I'm stressed. I've been dealing with a lot of constant stress, including all of the other problems I've had before these changes.

I feel like normally I handle things pretty well. But lately everything has been getting to me. Every new form of stress seems to be amplified and my whole world seems like it's ending. Even though I always figure everything out, lately it feels like every new stressor is ""my last straw"" of sorts.

I haven't smoked weed in 2/3 weeks because of this new job. I can smoke again since I was hired but I kinda don't want to until I learn to handle this stress better. Idk if my lack of handling everything well is directly related to me not smoking, but I feel like it's playing a factor. Before this, I haven't been sober in 4-5 years.

Today was an interview for one and they offered me a good position similar to the one I hold now with my current job. A small problem is they want me to start right away at the same hours I’m scheduled for my current job. My current job schedules 3 weeks out I have some days off where I can go in for training with this new job if accepted and if I tell my current job they might be able to adjust week 3 to this schedule. What I’m worried about is this job not allowing for that to happen and my current job to get frustrated and fire me. I really need this other job it pays a little more and it’s more of an opportunity but I like my current one because I know I am employed. What should I do? I’ve never been in a situation like this.

17x00ri,stress,"I'm not recovering from my burnout, I already quit study 2 years ago","What caused my burnout in the first place was the combination of homework and problems in my private life, like depression and friendships not going well. I was already overloaded with stress, half a year before I quit studying. I quit way too late, I got deep into burnout.

So 2 years ago I quit studying. Been home 24/7 ever since then. Had CBT therapy for depression, didnt help a bit. Got addicted to gaming cause I had nothing else to do. Now im not addicted to gaming anymore but still addicted to the internet in general. I'm still at very, very, very low energy levels.

I actually feel more mentally tired than the moment I quit studying. So it seems like even though I dropped the mountains of homework, I'm not recovering my burnout but its actually getting worse

I think its because stress is always present in my life. I'm depressed and have autism, my life is not going the way I want, so I have alot of problems both in my head and in my environment. Also my dad died 4 months ago, kind of unexpectedly.

What also makes recovery hard for me is the fact that I'm always impatient, I always want my problems to be solved, my todo list to be empty... so even though i feel tired and unmotivated and am uable to get significant amounts of work done, i still always have the urge to either do or worry about my todo list. I cannot really relax. Even if I try to relax, if i ride my bike or play a game... it just doesnt feel relaxing because i know that after the activity, my todo list with 1000 things is still there waiting for me.

At this point is recovery just impossible for me??? I feel lost I don;t know what to do anymore",2023-11-16 22:54:14,2,5,1,Negative,-0.07115384615384615,0,0,0
16ox32l,stress,What are your coping strategies? (A discussion about mine),"When I find myself in the unpleasant situation of stressing out or even having anxiety attacks, I follow some coping strategies have helped me navigate through these experiences. One significant approach is trying to stay present and deal with the emotions instead of attempting to disassociate. This has made significant progress in my personal journey regarding this issue. Every time you set the problem aside, it often returns even bigger, of course, there's no one fixed answer for what to do in these moments as stress and anxiety are phenomena that every single human being experiences to some extent, therefore each person has their unique way of dealing with it, and for some, it takes more effort than for others.

Moreover, I've found it really interesting how sticking to a small routine or ritual within a day helps bring a sense of stability and consistency that keeps me grounded and more focused, making it easier for me to manage my stressors, mine is skin care but it can vary depending on the individual.

An interesting article I came across on the web examines the properties of chamomile and whether it can help people dealing with stress (Galante et al., 2017). The authors mentioned how chamomile is one of the most widely used herbal remedies in the world and that it is included in the pharmacopoeia of 26 countries. As a fun fact, the use of chamomile as an herbal remedy dates back to ancient Greece and Rome and since I am greek/cypriot and chamomile has been in my culture we always kind of associate it with relaxing or sleeping.

Some other techniques that I've heard from friends find helpful include journaling and trying to limit screen time, the impact of social media on our mental health is substantial, but that's a topic for another discussion.

1d40hi8,university,"My High School Threatens to Revoke My University Offer, what should I do?","As a recent graduate from a Chinese public high school's international department, I've been accepted to the University of California, Davis. My academic record has been consistently excellent, earning the school's top scholarship for two consecutive years. I appreciate the influence of several foreign teachers, but the school's management has been chaotic. Over the past three years, I've endured suffering and anxiety due to the school's negligence. They often dismiss students' concerns and fail to take action. For instance, when I was verbally abused by a male student with extremely inappropriate language, the school not only failed to discipline him but also forbade me from mentioning the incident again, forcing me to delete my social media post about it. Consequently, the school knew my social media account.

 In the final semester of my senior year, a misunderstanding with my teacher led to two failing grades, falsely accusing me of taking a vacation to Thailand while on sick leave. Even after the misunderstanding was clarified, my assignments were unreasonably marked down. Despite numerous attempts to address the unfair grading through emails to the academic dean and teachers, they ignored my communications until my parents finally met with the academic dean two months later to resolve the issue. This incident left me deeply frustrated. When I stumbled upon a post about my high school, I commented, ""Trash school, run fast"" (verbatim), reflecting my overall sentiment after three years and numerous infuriating incidents. Two days after attending the graduation ceremony, the school accused me of ""severe misconduct"" and demanded that my parents and I return to the school immediately, disregarding our arrangements on that day. The school administration showed us screenshots of my comments on social media, claiming that my evaluation of the school was defamatory and insulting, accusing me of spreading false information and slander. I fail to understand how expressing my opinion on social media is problematic, and I wonder if the school monitors my social media activity constantly. They claimed to be well aware of the university I would be attending and threatened to email the university alleging that I am morally corrupt unless I delete the two comments. They asserted their intention to ruin me effortlessly. Despite my explanations for posting the comments, they ignored me and insisted that they were fabrications.

 Now, I'm suffering from depression and anxiety due to this ordeal. I have deleted the comments, but I cannot guarantee that the school won't send defamatory documents. I want to know if the university will revoke my offer if the school sends such an email. Additionally, I'm concerned about whether the school's threats will persist after I enroll in university. If I expose the school after starting university, will they continue to threaten and intimidate me? I greatly appreciate your attention to my situation, and any advice would be immensely valuable.

I would love to ask you, how you would professionaly solve this issue.

I am in the end of my master thesis. The topic is quite complex, related to the neurodevelopmental disorders and variations in postsynaptic density protein link to them. The goal were that I am going to filter out potential pathogenic coding variations in data from schizophrenia patients and then check out the pathogenicity in databases, literature and potentially with experimental procedures ( like immunocytochemistry).

However from star there were a big problem. My supervisor actually is experimental biologists without any proper knowledge in bioinformatics. What's worse I didn't have any proper knowledge either (only in highschool a little bit molecular dynamics, but no genomics). The topic is vague as well. I got schizophrenia data inside vcf, but the second part were related to all neurodevelopmental disorders (got not even definition of neurodevelopmental from my supervisor). 

So after almost whole school year during in 2020/2021, he gave me advisors. But there were a catch. Eventhough she have worked with this topic, she is not trained bioinformatician or statistician. So I got vague advices, not only because she is not linked directly with my theses, but more that she just doesn't have a time and proper knowledge to answer me.

I am not writing down this post, because I have my supervisor and I need to vent those emotions. I feel lost. I don't want to hurt his reputation, but even now before my deadline he is ghosting me. Still I haven't been most amazing student, but because the COVID and stress from that topic, I have been diagnosed with epilepsy and I was quite a mess. Eventhough I were quite anxious to even go in that laboratory, I don't think his behaviour is professional and acceptable for his position as senior researcher or am I wrong?

I feel like i couldn’t breathe high, and even sober it’s that way too. this constant stomach tension, an uneasy feeling and with the difficulty breathing is making life unlivable. it’s easy to convince i have something i don’t know about, i can’t take anyone’s advice because i am so selfish about myself, like i know everything. but i seriously don’t. i feel like some days my body will just give out because it can’t handle it for too long, i seriously don’t know. it is horrible anxiety. i want to believe it is. years of stress and not doing anything has really caught up to me and i hate this so much. waking up with something even after talking is annoying, all the sadness turned into anger. i just yell at people. it’s self sabotage. and i don’t know how to get out of the mindset i placed myself in. 

talking helps, but then it doesn’t hours later, or the next day, i can’t be on my own thinking without believing im going to die or i have something underlying. i want everything to be ok. but i can’t convince.  ",2024-06-17 23:39:23,2,5,1,Negative,-0.07245098039215686,0,0,0

At 14 I came home to an empty home and found out that my dad move across the state with my little brother. I spent the next 4 years sleeping on people’s couches and drifting to about 8 different “homes” in the process. In my vulnerable state at 16 I started dating a 21 year old abusive alcoholic. After 25 years and he turning into a drug addict, I finally got away and divorced him. He made a 6 figure income compare to my 1/3 income of what he made and I didn’t have family to fall back on. I wasn’t going to go back to sleeping on people’s couches with 3 kids in tow. I really thought I would be better once the divorce was finalized and ties were cut with him. It will be a year next month. I’ve done years of therapy and medication, but I’m so damn exhausted. I’m also in a stressful job where my plate has now become a pan that is overflowing with no support and it’s basically, just figure it. Anyway, I DO NOT say any of this for sympathy, but I’m wondering at what point does years of chronic stress call for an extended period of time off to maybe recuperate if that’s even possible?

1dte7p5,academia,Replacing a difficult committee member? ,"Hello r/academia

I’m a humanities PhD candidate entering my 7th and (planned) last year of my PhD. I will be going on the job market this fall. I had a somewhat unsupportive committee member who refused to write me a letter of recommendation last year when I wanted to go on a trial round of job apps because I didn’t make as much progress as they hoped, while the other two committee members including my advisor were onboard. They have been in general more demanding than the other members over the years. But I don’t know if it makes sense to replace them now, although I DO have two better candidates and one of them has already agreed to join my committee as the fourth member. However, there’s no guarantee that they can write me a letter this fall given their very new involvement with my project, and said unsupportive professor might agree now that I’ve made a bit more progress - but again, I don’t know, and I’m in general stressed out by every interaction with them because I always worry that they won’t support me. The situation is quite delicate: said unsupportive professor is now chair of my program, and I also need to TA for them this fall. So, I’m worried it might place further strain on our relationship and cause more problems than it solves if I replace them. I’d appreciate any advice! Would it be better to replace them now? Is it realistic to expect letters from two new members in a few months if they do read all the chapters I’ve drafted? Is it generally not wise to change committee members this late? I’ve heard that sometimes people do it last minute. ",2024-07-02 05:30:01,5,4,1,Positive,0.05438762626262627,0,0,2

","Hello r/Stress community, I'm making this post here because it covers a lot of mental health disorders (CPTSD, chronic stress, tension, anxiety, fight-or-flight, etc) and it can be very helpful and useful to anyone. I also would like more information and help for myself and others but for the most part I want to share what has worked for me so far.

As the title says, I also want to know exactly how exercise really helps here, I went to the gym and I'll share my personal thoughts below, but I want to know what anyone else thinks and knows about why exercise helps here with these issues, as well as any other non-exercise-related advice that they can give and share.

**The Story**

So, I will first share my story, i am M24 and I have been through a traumatic event over one year ago after being a victim of ID theft & fraud, a loan of £25,000 was fraudulently taken in my name by identity fraudsters from a bank they scammed and I developed trauma, stress, tension, anxiety and a constant fight-or-flight from this. Interestingly I was far more hurt by the bank and it's cutthroat treatment of me more than anything else, I'm sure the bankers knew all too well that they're in the wrong but they insisted on hurting me anyway as much as they could and try to hold me liable by force, my personal experience was that they were corrupt and ruthless themselves, this left some serious mental scars on me. The whole matter was pretty much resolved though (see my other posts on my personal profile), every party involved turned their back against the bank and sided with me including Debt Collectors and the Finacial Ombudsman, everyone knows the bank was full of crap, but the bank infuriated me a lot because of how unfairly it was treating me with no remorse, and it made me go into full-blown war mode in the conflicts I had with it.


**The Symptoms**

The symptoms I developed are varied but in April of 2023 when the conflict began they started as stress, agitation, restlessness, tiredness, fatigue, a sensation of conflict and lack of safety and comfort, before July of 2023 when the conflict with the bank got more intense and the fight-or-flight mode instantly switched on and stress hormones flooded my body.

Then in July of 2023, one day the fight-or-flight switched on and I had a sudden and rapid onset of extreme headaches, head pressure sensations, tension headaches with moving sensations, head pulsations and pounding (which was strong enough to physically make my head move with the pulsations, sleeping was very difficult, these pulsations felt like my heart was beating at the back of my head), sensations of pain akin to fybromialgia in my teeth, jaw, around my eye sockets and on my skull bones (my whole face was hurting with pain), a feeling of extreme rage (I'm talking about a Viking Berserker's Rage type of rage. A rage so extreme it consumed all, I avoided being around people for months because of how scared I was by the intensity of the rage and how easily anything would irritate me, and when I would be alone at home I would roar in rage a few times to release it, if not I would punch a pillow. Very unusual, I think this was part of the primal fight-or-flight response to prepare me for a fight with a stronger adversary, like a bear or a tiger. My conflict with the bank certainly felt to me like I was in a fight with a strong enemy) and lots of physical energy and strength (from excess adrenaline and cortisol), rapid uncontrollable heart beats and high blood pressure, tinnitus, brain zaps, hot sweats that felt like my body and head were burning, extreme restlessness and insomnia, bodily pain, an urge to stretch my body and jaw in response to the tension, dizziness (feeling like the room spins around me), constant irritability and negativity, initially I had a weird sensation of strong sexual arousal (due to the stress hormones initial effect) which subsided and then made me suffer from E.D. and lack of libido, inability to think clearly and deeply, inability to concentrate and focus, loss of cognitive proficiency, IBS symptoms (which at first really confused me as I never had such issues ever and I was scared of what was happening to my body), my state of stress became Chronic, a constant fight-or-flight state (from Sympathetic Nervous System Hyperarousal), and a whole lot of other terrible symptoms.
Emotionally I was revolted with rage, next up I then felt a lot of emotional and physical pain, next then I was feeling fear and panic, and I finally became stuck in a mixed state of constant revolt and conflict as well as panic, fear, anxiety and worry.
These symptoms I listed here have all persisted for about 4-5 months in combination before they began to improve noticeably.

(As you can see, I had all of the symptoms under the sun associated with stress, tension, trauma, anxiety and fight-or-flight, and I even had them all at once in July of 2023 which was terrible enough)


**The Improvements**

Thankfully, after more than a year, about half of these issues disappeared, and all the other ones had improved, yet some are still stuck and I still need improvement to get back to normal.
My mind and body are still not balanced enough, I haven't attained complete homeostasis and the Parasympathetic Nervous System is not yet half as activated as it should be, while the Sympathetic Nervous System is still at least half-active.
Symptoms that stick around are the head pulsations (which decreased in intensity, but still continue), a few minor headaches, my neck and back of my head makes cracking and snapping noises often, my heart beats a bit more rapidly than normal (although not as rapidly as it did before), I have apathy, I feel like a shell of my former self (Very far from who I was before all of these events, no joy, no happiness, no pleasure, no humour, no motivation), I have E.D. and lack of libido (although my E.D. improved a little bit in time, still I'm not back to normal), some digestive and IBS issues persist but in a mild and reduced way (I understood that IBS is caused by stress, when blood flow isn't traveling to the stomach as much, as the body's focus is shifted towards survival mode. Overtime as the stress fades, the body's regular functions recover), a lingering state of fight-or-flight and generally some lack of a sense of comfort, of safety, and my mind mistrusts that I can ever feel safe again, it's like it is always expecting for something bad to happen at anytime and it remains on high alert so that it is never taken by surprise. It's like it always expects something bad to happen next and it doesn't want to have its guard down. 
I understand that these reactions are my body's mechanism of protecting me, and funnily enough I experienced a bit more improvement when I understood that this was a good thing and I became a bit more thankful towards my body when I understood that it did all of this to keep me safe from what it perceived as danger. But at the same time, this is clearly a misconception of my body that needs to be rectified. Nonetheless, understanding that your body is working FOR YOU and not against you is a good thing to do.

(As you can see, I understood very well overtime how my mind and body reacted, why they reacted like they did, and all the underlying details. I hope this at least also provides some helpful information for those who suffer from those symptoms and are baffled by what's really going on as I was. When such conditions strike, we freak out over what's going on with our bodies because we don't understand why they react the way that they do)


**The Solutions**

I have taken many approaches to restore myself, within the last 3-4 months I managed to really improve compared to how I was one year ago. I understood that a holistic and comprehensive approach is in order to really get the solution that I seek, so these approaches include : 

**1. - Doing Therapy** - I followed 3 different therapy programmes with 3 different therapy services, 2 of them focused on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and one was specifically for Overcoming Low Mood. This was very helpful and helped change my way of thinking, processing,  interpreting and perceiving into a more healthier way.

**2. - Socialising -** At first I became secluded from the world and avoidant of people, but I began to socialise and find social groups where I can engage with people. These really helped cleanse my mind and my experience of the world and brought in a fresh sense of positivity and human connection which helped move my mind away from my troubles and make me more engaged with the world. Socialising helps take us out of our own minds and brings us back into the flow and rhythm of the world around us, which is as things should normally be.

I realised quickly that we need to connect with people in order to move on from trauma, when we suffer from trauma, we suffer from being stuck in a loop where our thoughts are laser-focused on the negative event. And we cannot move on because we do not allow ourselves to connect with people and create fresh new positive memories that can replace the negative impact of the bad memories. 
I was stubborn at first, and didn't really want to socialise with anyone, but that was an error of my own wounded mind, the truth is we are human beings designed to connect with others and socialise, and trauma can be overriden and rendered meaningless once you make enough positive memories and experiences to wash it away. With enough good memories and experiences to counter trauma, you dilute the trauma.

**3. - Meditation -** I began to meditate in nature, I would go to a park nearby and just sit on the grass with eyes closed and pay attention to my other senses without thinking about anything at all. This was and still is a challenge because my mind got so used to being stressed and devoid of concentration, but I do it anyway. This is very good and makes me feel slightly better each time.

Engaging in meditation requires adapting a state of peace and calm, even if it must be forced a bit. Calmness is oftentimes overlooked, but it is the first thing that we lose in dealing with mental issues, and usually the last thing we tend to think about. So getting that calmness and peace back helps bring us back more to our normal selves and natural way of being.

**4. - Deep Breathing -** I began to breathe deeply through my diaphragm, which initially was very difficult to do as my body was by default rushing my breaths and trying to breathe through my chest due to being in a constant fight-or-flight which made it tough, but I persisted. Deep breathing helps activate the Parasympathetic Nervous System which is key to defeating fight-or-flight.
I use the 4-7-8 Deep Breathing method, where I breathe in through the nose for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and then breathe out through the mouth slowly for 8 seconds. 
I now set aside at least 15 minutes daily for deep breathing and for the 4-7-8 technique, and I breathe deeply anytime I remember to do it. I believe the real benefits come from engaging in deep breathing in a cumulative way, where everytime you breathe deeply, you adapt and accustom the mind and body to naturally breathe slowly and deeply unconsciously without needing your conscious effort any longer. This helps reset the breathing pattern back to normal permanently.

**5. - Taking Supplements -** I began to research the best supplements for combating chronic stress, anxiety, and fight-or-flight. After a lot of research, I began a routine of taking the following supplements daily : 
- Magnesium Citrate
- Calcium Citrate
- Zinc Citrate 
- Vitamin B-Complex
- Vitamin D 
- Gingko Biloba
- Probiotics
- Peppermint Oil Capsules

All of these supplements help to combat stress and anxiety in some way, they also help with hormones & other chemical processes in the body, as well as helping with other issues brought about by stress.
The catch with supplements is that you need to take them continuously for at least 2 or 3 months before you can fully notice their effects and benefits, but it is very worthwhile. You may feel benefits sooner than 2 or 3 months, but they are not a quick fix like you take a magnesium pill now and expect to be stress-free the next day, it doesn't work like that, this is a long-term strategy to change the chemical composition and processes in your body.

**6. - Positive Thinking and Optimism, as well as Stopping being Obsessed with the cause of my Trauma -** For a long time I was far too obsessed with my identity theft & fraud situation and the bank dispute than I wanted to admit to myself, I was stuck in daily a loop of obsession, constant spite and disgust towards the bank, constant worry, constant agitation, constant hurt. I was obsessing, ruminating, worrying and feeling sorry for myself 24/7.

Trauma doesn't improve unless we stop thinking obsessively about the things that traumatised us, and then when we no longer obsess, we can then take a much needed break and reset our mind. Following that, we can then voluntarily return to the memory of the traumatic event and think more clearly with a fresh mind and process what happened much better and in healthier ways and more objectively rather than subjectively and personally.
I eventually got sick of thinking about the same situation over and over again, as if I have nothing better to do with my life. Am I seriously reducing my whole entire existence to just obsessing over this crap, and letting it prevent me from moving on and living my life happily ? Letting this actually control my life and twist my future? I became sick of it once I realised what I was actually doing to myself for many months. So I managed to stop obsessing, and began to put the whole thing out of my mind and not let it trouble me with painful memories. I did this initially by intentionally ""distracting"" myself by socialising with people - when you're too busy interacting with people all the time, you don't have time to worry about what's on your mind. That's how I mentally moved away from my obsession for the first time.

After I managed to no longer obsess over this, I then changed the situation in my mind as being ""Unimportant"" and ""Irrelevant"". How? Simple ! I just knew that since I didn't do what the bank accused me of doing, there's no point in me stressing over it. My conscience is at peace because I know the truth that I did not take that fraudulent loan. So this is not a problem for me to worry about, but for the fraudsters and criminals who are the ones who did this! This is not a problem that was mine, but instead one that was forcefully and unfairly IMPOSED on me by the bank for me to have in an ATTEMPT to make me treat this problem as if it were mine, when it never was in the first place. This is not a problem that I have and neither that I should have. The bank tried to gaslight me all along because it was desperate to recoup its losses by any means necessary and from anyone, even if it was unethical to force a victim of ID theft & fraud to pay for what some criminals did. When I understood this basic fact, I knew this situation is nothing more than a momentary distraction in my life.

I further removed the effect of the trauma by being ignorant towards it. Why ignorant ? Because ignorance is BLISS !! Ignorance is what is needed in order to no longer let trauma affect us. Before this traumatic incident, I lived my life in blissful ignorance, and that's why I was so happy without a worry or care in the world. Therefore, in order to be happy again, we need to become blissfully ignorant towards the traumatic incidents that took our happiness away from us. This diffuses all of the pain that trauma tries to induce. When you ignore it, it loses it's effect on you.

Once I realised these things, something just clicked. 
But I took this further by adapting positive thinking and optimism. You know that a study revealed that 70% of the things we worry about never happen? I began to feel much more at ease knowing that nothing is as bad as I thought. When I had a clearer mind and understanding, I could also finally see that really there's nothing for me to be worried about, and I backed this up with palpable proof and evidence. All in all, I began to look at this seeming disaster as a somewhat of a positive thing rather than something that would destroy me and my life.

**7. - Exercise -** I began to hit the gym and exercise 3 days a week.
I do 30 minutes of Cardio running on the treadmill, sometimes I do even 45 minutes.
I alternate between running (at paces between 7.0 to 10.0) to walking (at paces between 4.0 to 5.5) at various intervals in order to push my body for a while, then let it calm down and relax a bit, then push it again, then let it relax a bit again, rinse and repeat until the session is finished. I also use an incline of 3.0 and sometimes 4.0, and I also try as much as I can to engage with diaphragmatic breathing throughout my Cardio session, I can't breathe as deeply or hold my breath while actively moving, but I try to consciously breathe through my diaphragm instead of my chest.
I also lift weights and use the gym machines afterwards for a full body workout. And yes I drink lots of protein shakes, they're indispensable.

I have read that exercise and in particular Cardio workouts help with overcoming stress, tension, anxiety and fight-or-flight. What happens during Cardio is the stress hormones become metabolised and then they get expelled from the body, this is one of the only reliable ways to really get rid of the stress hormones in large quantities I.e. actually set yourself free from stress.
Everything else and all other methods I listed do help as well, but exercise actually uses up the cortisol, adrenaline, etc other stress hormones that get stuck in the body and exercise is required to move them out and flush them out of the body. 

Some study I read (sorry dont remember exactly, need to look it up again) also has shown that people who suffered from PTSD/CPTSD who have done a 30 minute Cardio workout right before beginning their therapy sessions have had far less symptoms associated with trauma, and far better improvements in their therapy sessions as well as better results and outcomes with their trauma issues. So exercise is no joke.

Exercise also produces good hormones such as endorphins, and it also does produce some amounts of cortisol, but this happens in a controlled way and you burn far more cortisol off than you produce. And if you suffered from CPTSD, Chronic Stress, Anxiety and Fight-Or-Flight well then you know that your body is literally flooded with cortisol and adrenaline which you need to burn off. 
In turn and after about 3 months of constant Cardio, your body's physiology changes and your mind and body become more resilient to stress and you no longer feel the stress (from exercise or from any other source, including trauma) because you have forged your body through controlled exercise to adapt to stress and no longer be startled by it.

Finally, a good point someone else made elsewhere and a personal discovery of mine regarding combating Fight-Or-Flight through exercise is that when you do Cardio on the treadmill, you create a simulation of ""running away and escaping from a threat"", which helps to calm down the mind and body after the session is finished and overcome the Fight-Or-Flight trauma response. 
After the end of a successful Cardio treadmill session, your mind and body ""think"" that because they ran so much and now they ceased and can walk normally, that you have escaped from a threat, from danger, and that you are now safe. And then they begin to behave accordingly, calming you down and lowering the heart rate. 

I also believe that exercise is crucial to lowering the heart rate to a calm and steady rhythm, as opposed to the high heart rate associated with fight-or-flight. I think this occurs because at the end of strenuous exercise, the mind and heart NATURALLY slow down and chill out. Everytime you finish a workout session, the heart calms down a little more. Overtime this impresses upon the body a natural and calm state, and the mind and heart begin to ""remember"" how to calm down. After many months of exercise I think it is not surprising why the heart rate decreases generally to a calm heart rate.

Furthermore, what keeps Fight-Or-Flight in a state of constancy is the lack of movement, motion or deliberate action to shake it off. The body stays stuck with tension thinking that it has to do something urgently to recover safety but it doesn't know what to do, this creates a tension where the muscles in the body get frozen between ""engaged"" and ""disengaged"", all of that tension needs to be released somehow and exercise is the best and possibly the only reliable way to do it. We suffer from tension and fight-or-flight because we need to put our body in motion and release all of that tension there for it to be relieved and satisfied that it has done something to avert danger, and then it can begin to behave normally again.

So, these are all of my insights, discoveries, my story and everything I learned which I thought would be great to share with you all

Finally, a few more methods which I have heard can help but I haven't tried yet seem to include Acupuncture and Sauna. Apparently they provide some benefits too, though I haven't tried them yet.

17io5te,students,Help for teen fears and anxiety,"Problem:
Post pandemic students have been struggling with going to school. When we think about back to school, we often focus on getting our children supplies, books, and any other material needs related to school. Too often, as parents, we forget about their psychological state. What are the fears, stressors or anxieties triggered by school? How do I prepare them to face it?

First place to start is knowing some of their fears and anxieties. In my research,  I was surprised to see quite a long list.  At that moment, I decided to write affirmations to counterattack the mental,emotional and physical stressors that kiddos go through on and off campus.

1e0pyd5,academia,i yearn for validation from supervisor and i'm jealous of my groupmate,"my research groupmate (sharon) never gets bad feedback from our prof, and i notice he always uses the word 'great' when referring to her work. he always uses the word 'good' when referring to mine, and i don't think he's impressed with my work as much as sharon's.

my friends tell me i'm overthinking it, especially because my prof does say we're doing great work (when referring to us in general). he also never pointed out what's wrong with my work. no one tells me i am fucking things up, but it bugs me so much that i'm good and not great....

so i finally asked him yesterday about how i can do better as i suspected something was off with a recent update i made. after hearing his response i now know why sharon's work is deemed better (although he didn't explicitly say this). it's not that big of a deal and i'm fixing mine now, but i can't help but feel envy that i couldn't be as perfect as her in my prof's eyes.

has anyone been in a similar situation? i am now spiraling a bit because i worry that i've ruined my chances to be in this research group for longer because i've made a bad impression. i spent like 4 hours just sobbing, worried even after i polish my work, my prof will still think it's not great. 

i'm not only worried i'm an imposter, now i'm worried about feeling like i'm in a constant rivalry with people i'm in a group with. i don't want academia to turn me into someone like that.  sharon is actually very nice to me and not a dick at all, but i can't help this need to feel 'chosen' over her. if she gets offered another job and i don't i would be very devastated and i feel horrible for being this petty. for example, i have a meeting with them soon and i keep thinking sharon will get praise for doing things faster since i'm currently experiencing a setback (since i have to make edits that sharon doesn't need to do).

1erfgqo,college,do you have to talk to your roommates,so i am moving into an apartment with two girls who go to the same school as me. none of us were friends before hand. we had signed the lease back in march and had only met up all together at school one time which was in march too. we have been in communication since then but only about apartment stuff other than that we don’t talk. our lease started beginning of july but we don’t start school until end of august so we’ve just been slowly moving in. but since we signed the lease back in march and discussed what each of us were getting already i feel like there really wasn’t much we could talk to each other about from march to now. my mom is all worried that i’m not talking to them or don’t reach out and keeps saying it’s going to be uncomfortable living there if we don’t talk. we’re not even living together yet but i don’t know why she thinks i’m like going to ignore them if they say something to me or text me. i’m a quiet person but im not rude and don’t just not answer to someone. i don’t have any friends like actually zero and i know my mom is trying to push me to be friends with them bc of that. she literally said to me “don’t you want to be friends with them”. i feel like they only see me as just a roommate who’s helping pay the rent so we can all be there for school. like they both have there own friends and obviously i’m not going to force them to be friends with me. they haven’t reached out to me about anything beyond the apartment or tried to start a conversation so i don’t feel the need to either. it’s not like i don’t want to be friends with anyone it’s just super hard for me to make friends bc i am really quiet at first and to people that comes off as like don’t talk to me. but again i don’t want to force them to be friends with me just bc we’re roommates. maybe for my mom living with roommates she doesn’t talk to will be uncomfortable for her but for me it’s not uncomfortable. we all have different school and work schedules so most of the time we won’t be at the apartment a lot anyways and we have our own things to get done. if there were to be a problem or issue with the apartment i would obviously say something to them and i’m sure they would do the same back but i feel like there won’t be any communication besides about the apartment,2024-08-13 18:33:03,2,4,1,Positive,0.058055555555555555,0,0,2

Really hoping I can get some help with this...

  
I get what I believe to be a sudden flood of Cortisol before speaking with friends or even just thinking about public speaking.

Does anyone have any advice on a supplement or diet that can lessen the effects of Cortisol or anxiety in general in these situations? I don't drink caffeine and I don't consume drugs or alcohol. Diet and sleep schedule are average.

Any insight at all would be extremely helpful and appreciated. This really negatively effects my quality of life when it happens.

1eo6fxd,careeradvice,Am I making a mistake leaving my current job for a new one?,"Sorry for the walls of text in advance. 

I’ve been working at my current role for over 4 years and recently I’ve been feeling really burnt out. The culture has degraded immensely over the last 2 years because of changes in leadership, and because of this the overall work environment has been increasingly negative. Leadership is cold and there is little to no direction, leading to confusion and frustration. It’s just a very depressing and stressful environment overall and to top it all off the pay is shit for my tenure and the work that I do. I recently found another opportunity that’s more in line with my career and there are quite a few perks that swayed me: 

1. Pay is higher by almost 25%
2. Fully remote (Current job is 3 days in office)  
3. Culture and leadership seems very positive on first impressions.

The only thing is that it’s 1 year contract role. I’d still be a T4 employee and have all the benefits that a permanent would get, and the recruiter mentioned that there would be a high chance of extension and flipping to permanent, but nonetheless I am transitioning from a permanent role to a fixed term one. 

I’ve talked it over with many former peers and mentors and they all say that it is a good decision, the only ones who don’t think so are my Director and one of my coworkers. They’re largely apprehensive to the fact that is a contract position and that It would be a risk. My director suggested that I should just use that offer as leverage and get a better salary and role at my current company. It sounds compelling, but honestly it doesn’t address the underlying issues and my gut instincts say that I need a change. 

I’m currently still living with my parents and don’t have any major responsibilities, so in my opinion if there’s any time to make a choice like this in my life, it’s now. I know that grass isn’t always greener, but I just can’t stand work anymore. I can’t stand going into office, and I can’t stand the environment.

Right now a lot of the anxiety I have is from my current work wanting me to stay and the points my director raised against the other job. They really really want me to stay and were not expecting me to leave so it just threw everyone for a loop. Since there have been ongoing cuts to the department, they really weren’t expecting me to leave as well. Honestly I am pretty excited about a new opportunity and team but I feel like the excitement is being hampered down my by my current employer. 

What do you guys think? Do you think I’m making the right move here? ",2024-08-09 17:59:07,1,2,1,Positive,0.07863960302735813,0,0,2

1emmhfi,careeradvice,"Transitioning Back to Development After 10 Years ?
","Hi everyone,I'm looking for some guidance and advice on my career path, and I would greatly appreciate your insights.

Here's a bit about my background:

I graduated with a diploma in programming in 2015 and worked as a developer for a few companies. However, I realized that this field wasn't for me due to the stress and lack of enjoyment I felt. Almost 10 years ago, I decided to leave programming.Since then, I've been freelancing, primarily helping people and product owners manage their affiliate programs. This experience has allowed me to develop various skills, such as technical thinking, problem-solving, consulting clients, and more.

Now, at 30 years old, I'm feeling quite lost. I need a stable salary to meet life's demands and, after some deep thinking, I've realized that I'm not an expert in any particular skill that could secure me a stable job for the long term. One thing I've enjoyed during my freelancing years is working with WordPress, especially solving basic to complex plugin problems. Given my programming background, I'm considering diving into WordPress development.

However, I'm apprehensive about returning to programming. I'm worried about investing time in learning again, only to end up disliking it and quitting once more. I would love to hear your thoughts and advice on: How to overcome the fear of returning to a field that previously caused stress and dissatisfaction.

1. Whether WordPress development is a viable and stable career path in the current market.
2. Any alternative career paths that might suit my background and skills.

1eq8ely,careeradvice,Accepted internal job offer but deciding to not take it,"Hi all- my manager offered me a job role that is a band up which means a just a tiny pay increase however i have been doing training for the new job and its way more work than anticipated (manager initially said it was easy which is the reason why I accepted). The guy im covering the job for was leaving in a week’s time and 

My current job is supposed to be temporary to allow me to do a career shift and spend week nights self studying. Furthermore this job is a year’s fixed contract and i ideally would like to transition out sooner. My old job is good as i know how to do it now compared to picking up something new again that I dont really want to stay in for long. I do wish i thought about it more before accepting however the quickness of it all and slight pay bump made me jump at the opportunity (manager was pushing to give a reply if I was handing in application the same day) but i think it doesnt align with my career aspirations. 

Will it be bad to decline offer now that i accepted verbally? I havent signed the contract. Or should i stick it out? My manager will be the same for either jobs but im worried as they are planning for me to take this job and already closed the job apps that this will ruin my reputation. However, I really dont think this new job is the right fit for me.

1er2ac0,careeradvice,Had an emotional overload due to being exhausted at new job. Has come back to bite me regarding relationships with .coworkers Advice? Healthcare related.,"So I'm 25. I made a career switch from help desk to patient care technician at a dialysis facility. 

The hours aren't like usual workplaces. Your job could start at 3:30 am or 4:30 am and if you're lucky - 6:00 am . Last week I had a rough week after starting 4 weeks ago.

I've been trying to tough it out and juggle stress, anxiety and difficulties sleeping. 

I made some mistakes the week my manager wasn't here and we had a review 1 on 1 to discuss anything and my manager brought up some issues that the RN and doctor (who comes around rarely) that they reported against me for. I touched a machine without gloves but according to the RN , she had to tell me more than once. I don't recall her warning me more than once. Oh and cell phone usage . Where she said she had to tell me more than once about using my phone on the floor, don't remember that either (in my memory she told me once and I stayed off the phone). Another incident that I didn't immediately ask for help when I couldn't turn on the computer. 

I also noted that I could've been wrong about the manner of times but that I didn't know or believe it was more than once. 


Overall though, I'm usually more tight knit for criticisms and with all fairness, they were right to correct my behavior in all professional ideals. It wasn't that I didn't agree but the way I handled the situation that ultimately bothered me. I'm usually not that reactive and I allow people to say what they say and I take the criticisms by the chin. 

However I believe my behavior is due to the exhaustion. I had an outburst of tears during the review and had a slight emotional breakdown (I didn't attack anyone but let's just say that I wasn't coming off as a functional human being ). Following that week, I had to leave last Friday an hour into my shift because I got ill ....

I leaked too much saline on the floor while trying to hook up a machine. I tried to clean up my area using a mop. Attempted to do all of this at regular speed. I tried to extend the mop out but somehow the mop and stick part came apart but was fixable. It fucked me up. My heart felt like it wasn't getting enough pumps. I got sweaty really fast and I got scarily weak quickly. I got dizzy and could barely move without my heart feeling as if it would stop beating. I ended up stumbling to the bathroom to get control of myself and ended up realizing I needed to go home. I came home. Laid down and went to sleep. I felt a bit better by the coming Sunday but nonetheless, still tired. I was able to calm down and get better hold of myself emotionally. 


Due to this stint, I believe drama has happened in my workplace and people are talking about me. It's seemingly coming from the only male PCT. He's saying sly stuff under the guise of humor when he was much more different and nicer prior to the meeting I had with my boss. The RN is also very weird and said some  condescending stuff when I needed to discuss my schedule with my boss. 

I can tell that my boss has a slightly unprofessional relationship with the other employees and may have discussed what happened during the meeting. Now the RN, male PCT and once nice Biomed tech are sort of making my job uncomfortable. 

The problem is that I'm a bit tired and I really don't want to come to work with this drama as I'm already still trying to regulate myself as an employee . I don't know if I can handle other people's ambiguous bullshit and balance out my own response to the situation. It seems stressful and I've had troubles sleeping since it occured, which does affect my ability to work. 

With such a schedule and other issues following it, I will admit that my personality and behavior is a bit different than how I'd normally carry myself. I'm not like mean, rude and completely disruptive. I just come off a bit more naive, distant, sensitive kinda child like. I'm trying to fix it because it's not how I usually am but I can tell it's affected my workplace.

1dl3yb1,stress,From Stress to Strength: how I stopped fighting stress ,"We all know how overwhelming stress can be.  
Life's demands can sometimes feel like too much to handle.

Some scientists believe that the full mind-body response of our emotions evolved as a way to ensure our safety and survival throughout the years.  
Stress is part of it.  
We need to understand the cause and know how to handle it instead of trying to reject it.

Today, I’d like to share a simple yet powerful tool that has helped me manage stress better: a journal

**What is a Feelings Journal?** exactly what it sounds like: a place where you can document your emotions, daily experiences, and thoughts. 

**How Does It Help with Stress?**

1. Increased Self-Awareness: Writing down your feelings and their cause helps you recognize stress triggers and emotional patterns. Identifying these can be the first step in addressing the sources of your stress.
2. Emotional Release: Sometimes, just getting things off your chest can make a world of difference. A feelings journal provides a safe space to vent without judgment.
3. Problem-Solving Insights: Journaling can help you see your problems from a different perspective. When you write about what’s stressing you out, you might discover new ways to approach these issues.
4. Reflect and Grow: Periodically reviewing your journal entries can offer insights into how you’ve managed stress in the past, highlighting what works and what doesn’t.

**How to Get Started**

Starting a feelings journal is easy, and you don’t need any fancy tools. Here’s a quick guide to get you going:

1. Choose Your Medium: Whether it’s a traditional notebook or a digital app, pick what suits you best.
2. Set Aside Time: Dedicate a few minutes each day to jot down your thoughts and feelings. Consistency is key!
3. Write Freely\*\*: Don’t worry about structure or grammar. Just let your thoughts flow.
4. Be Kind to Yourself: Remember, this is a personal journey.

**Take time to review your past stressful experience.**  
Taking the time to review your past stressful experiences can help you identify patterns. This reflective practice will boost your confidence in handling stress. The next time you will encounter a similar experience you will recognize it and start reacting differently.

Stress can be great.

16pz9q1,stress,"Hey, i wish to share a personal experience on stress and how i overcame it. STORY TIME","Meditation has made a big difference in my life, and I want to share how it's touched me deeply.  
I remember when I first started meditating. Life was stressful, and I was overwhelmed with work and the noisy city around me. Stress and anxiety were always there, making my health and relationships suffer. A friend suggested meditation, and though I was skeptical, I decided to give it a try.  
At first, meditating felt like a struggle. My mind was used to racing thoughts and distractions, so sitting quietly and focusing on my breath was hard. But I kept at it, knowing that change takes time.  
As I practised meditation, I noticed changes in how I handled stress. I became calmer and clearer when dealing with tough situations. Instead of getting lost in my feelings, I could step back and watch my thoughts without judging them. This helped me make better decisions and deal with problems more effectively. I started watching many youtube videos on meditation and today i found the best of them all a true gem that really has changed my perspective. if you wanna watch it here is the link https://www.youtube.com/live/gfkvm6-Tjp4?si=I-x1Oxgtyv7bB\_Ju . I hope it helps someone else like it helped me  
Meditation also had a big impact on my mental health. I had been dealing with anxiety and occasional depression for a while and relied on medication to cope. But with meditation, I started feeling more at peace and content than ever before. It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, and I even needed less medication, which my doctor helped me with.  
My relationships improved too. Meditation helped me become more understanding and empathetic towards others. I became a better listener and communicator, making my connections with friends and family deeper and more meaningful.  
Physically, I slept better, had more energy, and experienced fewer headaches and stress-related health issues. I felt healthier and happier overall.  
One unexpected gift was finding my purpose and direction in life. Through meditation, I gained clarity about my goals and passions, which led me to pursue things that truly mattered to me.  
Meditation hasn't magically solved all my problems, but it has been a powerful tool for self-discovery and personal growth. It has brought me mindfulness, resilience, and inner peace, and I'm excited to see how it continues to shape my life. I'm deeply grateful for the positive impact it has had on every part of my life. Meditation isn't just a change; it's a heartfelt transformation.",2023-09-23 08:44:06,9,3,1,Positive,0.21262626262626258,0,0,2

1dbz26d,students,Senior Year: AP Physics 1 vs AP Biology,"Hey everyone, I’m currently a student a who will become a senior at the start of fall this year. I’m highly enthusiastic towards the STEM field and am interested in studying software or electrical engineering. I’m however, hesitant at taking AP Physics 1 ( Only AP Physics class offered) due to the other classes which I do plan on taking as follows:

AP Literature and Composition
AP Calculus AB (BC is not offered)
AP Chemistry
AP Bio/ AP Physics 1
AP Government
AP Microeconomics 
Strength Training

Especially since I plan on doing AP Chem, I’m worried I might overwhelm myself by taking Physics alongside it, but I feel like it best prepares me for my career of interest rather than Biology. I have Biology as a class which can fill my schedule aside from Physics. I heard it’s a good class to take alongside Chem since they tend to correlate a lot in content and applications.

I took Honors Physics (Apparently more difficult than AP according to my teachers/ ended with an A) sophomore year and still have a relatively strong familiarity with the content that is also present in AP Physics, but I simply don’t want to harm my time management and mental health regarding stress. 

For college, I really want to see if I have a shot at any of the top colleges in my state for engineering such as Northwestern and UIUC.

I would appreciate all the feedback, thanks.

I work remotely for multiple companies, so yeah, sometimes it can get stressful but not really that often. I do have a history of panic attacks but I don't get them anymore now. I used to have nocturnal panic attacks, actually. That's how it all started for me back in late 2020. I managed to escape this nightmare until 3 months ago when it came back after some health anxiety. The trigger was sudden heart palpitations one morning. I tried Lexapro for one week back in early December but it gave me insomnia and severe depression episodes.  
  
Went to another psychiatrist. Recent diagnosis - GAD + Panic Disorder. Both anxiety and panic levels are now significantly lower due to my medication (Trazodone + Alprazolam) My problem now is what the title says. I wake up early, I go to the restroom, go back in bed and can't really fall back asleep. I keep tuning and tossing and am aware of my heartbeat. I do not have panic attacks, just mild anxiety.  
Since that episode with Lexapro, my sleep basically went to shit.  
  
I am a smoker (nicotine) but I managed to cut down significantly to just 1 or 2 smokes per day. I tried quitting for good but that was hell. I take a couple of long walks every day, drink plenty of water, trying to eat as healthy as possible. I also have a stash of vitamins/supplements that I take periodically, not every day.

I work a great job in engineering at a consulting firm. I really enjoy the work we do along with my group, everyone is great and has taught me a lot. The thing is, work is the only thing I like about this city. 

Being from NJ, 99% of my closest friends live in New York City or work in the area of where I’m from (45 min outside of NYC). A few of them did live here in Boston but have since moved away. Over the last few months, I’ve been depressed as I’ve struggled to make new friends here. I’ve tried and have been involved in work events, after work sports, etc. 

I’ve really toyed with the idea of moving to NYC, since my company has an office there. It would be nice to do the same work in the same company while being close to friends and also close to my family at home.

Another thing too is that my job is hybrid. I go into the office 2-3 days a week and the majority of my coworkers never do. I’ll see some of them once a month or once every other month. The only reason that could potentially hold me back are site visits for projects we work on in the city, which are honestly pretty rare.

Does anyone have any advice for me? I still have to talk to my manager about it but I’m worried he’ll tell me no. I honestly don’t want to have to find another job. Or even better, has anyone ever done this before?

1dhfzly,stress,"Stress is Destroying Me, Scared of Losing my Apartment ","I've dealt with anxiety, stress, and trauma to varying degrees my whole life but my current situation has been such extreme high levels that I legitimately fear it's killing me. I'm in extreme debt from having to life off credit cards while unemployed for 8 months. Literally over a thousand job apps places during that time and I've only recently been able to find part time work which is progress and I'm happy about it, don't get me wrong, but I still can't afford my rent. 

Lease ends this month, don't meet income guidelines to get approved for a cheaper apartment anywhere (need to make 3x the rent so I'd need to find *checks notes* a $350 apartment in the year 2024, obviously not happening). Desperately afraid my landlord won't renew, he said he needs to put me on a monthly rental agreement for a couple months and then we can do another yearly lease (something about management company working having a rent increase starting in September and new contracts). If I'm on monthly that means he could legally decide to issue a 30 day notice to move out *for no reason* and since he does NOT like me, I'm scared that he's doing this intentionally to trick me and fuck me over. Also having serious surgery coming up in August so being kicked out right now, or especially after my surgery, would be extra devastating.

I keep trying to be hopeful that things will turn but the closer I get to the end of the month, the more scared I become that I will be served a notice to vacate. I also want to vomit every time I see my credit card balances go up by thousands in interest (plan to work with a bankruptcy attorney soon if I can afford it.) But I'm at the point now where I feel ""strung out"" 24/7, barely able to eat, vomiting from stress pretty regularly, just feels like I'm sitting around waiting for this vacate notice (which might not actually even happen).

I've been seeing a therapist for ptsd and stress/anxiety for over a year now and she keeps telling me I'm ""doing amazing considering everything"" but I most certainly am NOT. I just don't feel like she really sees or hears my pain and despair and that makes it all the worse. Same with my friends, they just don't seem to understand and give me empty platitudes that ""everything will be okay"" without any actionable, logical advice or any real comfort.

Has anybody been in a similar situation/similar level of stress? Were you able to do anything to help you feel ""prepared"" in case your biggest worries become reality? I think that's my main issue is that I just have absolutely zero backup plan if I suddenly can no longer live here.

After five years under a terrible Department head, I have found a position that allows me to retain my tenure while transferring to a different Dept with a lot fewer suicide attempts among students and conflicts between colleagues.

This last Dept. head made my life unbearable for the entirety of my experience there. He (older male) asked me (younger female) whether I live alone, joked about sharing a room to pay less for accommodation going to a conference together, and constantly threatened to have me fired even after I got my tenure (and started planning my escape). He would be constantly dissatisfied with everything, both failures and successes (I remember earning us a grant once and being told he'd ""had to correct way too much in the application I filled up"", so he was unhappy anyway). I lost sleep, my anxiety ramped up, and lost all my will to work and research. At this new Department, I will be taking more teaching hours and have no actual requirement (but no problem) to do research, which he has mocked as one of his strategies to pressure me to stay (I keep my tenure and salary, so who cares).

Anyway. They are making me attend one last Department meeting. I have some time to prepare. My transfer is all but finished, very official, and will most likely be completely finalized when this meeting comes about. I have had to postpone my vacation by a week to attend, so I would like to indulge my petty inner child and make it ""worth it"". Any ideas that are funny but not too extreme (I don't want a reputation at my new Dept., but they do know what's been going on)?

I’m freaking out cause I hate that I have to make a decision now, it seemed like before it would just be one or the other but things changed. I can hardly think of any pros or cons. 

I do know if I moved now I’d have a great roommate who really wants to be with me, I feel guilt over leaving them. 
I’ve been having unknown medical issues unexpectedly arise again, so im not sure if I’d be okay living far from my family until I know what’s going on with me.
I can get a job instead of going to college in the fall, and then go to a college in the spring.
I’m worried about not having much/any social interaction for a whole semester.

If I do wait, the new uni would be closer to home, I’d probably live with my family, I had always wanted to live away from them before this. But I also realised that with circumstances suddenly switching on me idk if im mentally prepared to move out in a week, I doubt im Independent enough as well to handle living on my own so unexpectedly.
I’m also not prepared in general, I have not bought anything for dorm living cause I didn’t expect this to happen.

I’m worried starting college later will lead me to graduating later, I don’t want to feel like im left behind. But I know that if I change my major (aero eng) the likely new university I’d go is in a city with LOADS of opportunity for bio/med majors. Though the other city also had a lot of opportunity for eng majors, but idek if that’s the major I want.
So maybe waiting could also let me figure out what I want to do again.

I’m sorry this is rambly, but I need to get these thoughts out and I really am hoping for some help on making a decision or at least any insight.",2024-08-11 05:00:06,3,5,1,Positive,0.016553030303030302,0,0,2

1bbeoe0,stress,I have had the most stressful month!,"My mom was found acting strange about 5 weeks ago and was found to have sepsis from an infected tooth. She was delirious in the hospital and it took her 5 days to come to. I flew out there to be with her since my sister refuses to do so even though she's retired and can be gone for long periods. I was out there for 3 weeks while she went from hospital to rehab. 

I would work for a couple of hours in the morning, go and stay with her for 8-9 hours, then go back home and work for a couple of hours. I was exhausted every single day. Then I was home for a week with her once she got discharged. She has definitely lost some cognitiveness and is very frustrating to be around. I left a week ago and she is on her own although I don't know how long that will last because she is getting more forgetful but refuses to have help come in. I couldn't work that 3rd week because we are only allowed to work 2 weeks out of state so I had to apply for FMLA and reduced pay for that week.

I told my sister that if this happens again, which I have no doubt something will happen in the next few months, that she needs to go and deal with it. I get an immediate ""Nope not me. I'm not going to spend days there. I know it's a hardship on you but I'm not doing it"". So now all I can think is in the next few weeks I'm going to have to fly out there again because i just know something is going to happen.

Then, just days after I got back home, I started having stomach pains, chills, fever. I go to urgent care on the second day of pain and they run tests and think it's appendicitis. I go for a CT scan where it's found to be diverticulitis but on the CT scan they find a suspicious ovarian cyst. Now I am waiting for an ultrasound appt to see if it has any cancerous properties and/or if I need surgery.

I have told my husband about the cyst, but I don't think he realizes that it could be serious. And god knows if I tell him he's going to get super stressed out because he was the entire time I was away with my mom. I'm not sure why he was so stressed about the time I was gone.

# Why Stress Management Matters

  
In the pursuit of personal growth, managing stress becomes a cornerstone for a balanced and thriving life. Let's delve into the why, how, and actionable steps to elevate your stress management game.

  
By recognizing, acknowledging, and actively managing stress, you enhance your mental clarity, emotional resilience, and overall quality of life.

# The Stress Body Connection

  
Understanding how stress manifests in your body is a powerful form of self-awareness.

By tuning into these signals, you gain insights into your stress triggers allowing yourself to address them proactively.

# 4 Ways to Deal with Stress

  
1. **Breathwork**

  
Take five minutes daily for intentional breathing. Inhale deeply, filling up your lungs, exhale slowly, focusing on your breath. This simple yet effective practice can instantly soothe your nervous system and bring a sense of calmness.

  
2. **Go for a Walk**

  
 A 15-minute walk can help to disconnect and refresh your brain. Do this 3 times a day with a goal of 10,000 steps to optimize your life.

  
3. **Daily Exercise**

  
Exercise is the key to a healthier and more energetic lifestyle, offering benefits that extend beyond physical well-being to include enhanced mood and mental clarity. Incorporating regular physical activity into your routine is a powerful investment in both your body and mind and helps eliminate stressors in your life.

  
4. **Read Personal Development Books**

  
Reading personal development books is like having a mentor at your fingertips, offering valuable insights and actionable strategies to navigate life's challenges and maximize your potential.

I understand that feeling overwhelmed at times is part of the experience--I've certainly experienced it, but the ending has always been rewarding. Moreover, I genuinely like going to school and learning.  
However, this semester has been awful. I have a toddler who has needs, am in class full time--I travel 2 hours each way on Thursday for two of those classes--and have a part-time job. In the last two months, I lost my dog, got sick, have hit financial difficulties, and no longer have the child care I relied on during the evenings. I have all A's, but this semester I mostly don't submit things on time--this is something I never do. I feel like I'm failing my self and my professors, and the crushing weight of it is making feel sick--literally. I made a mistake thinking I could do grad school--and commute nonetheless--full time. The idea that my grades might suffer despite the enormous self-sacrifice I am making to my mental health is unbearable.  
I feel overwhelmingly burnt-out and depressed. It has made productivity worse. I haven't brushed my hair in weeks. I cant find time for self-care no matter how hard I try. I feel guilty when I give myself time. I tell myself to not feel guilty, but the anxiety I have is too much to prevent that from really happening. The small yet critical amount of time that I had to do work today was occupied by an awful family fight between my husband and father-law, which naturally I got roped into. The idea of doing this for 6 more weeks gives me dread.  
I know I need to reach out to my school's psychological services, but I'm not sure how to address this with my professors.",2023-11-07 01:54:40,4,1,1,Negative,-0.013531746031746035,0,0,0
1enm02v,careeradvice,Need help ,"Job questions 

Hey all, I’m kinda in a dilemma. I graduated in December and just got an accounting job a few months ago. I really like the job and the people I work with are amazing and incredibly nice. But the pay is literally horrible (I could get a ~50% raise going to almost any other place) I currently make 23/hr in a m-hcol  area. It’s paying the bills and providing a little extra but I just got the nagging feeling in the back of my head about the pay. I’m just kind of torn. I love the people and the job and the company but I’m getting so underpaid compared to positions around me and I’m still fairly stressed about money (which I wouldn’t be at all if I got a salaried gig in most other careers near me). Anyone got any tips for me cause I’m torn and family is all over the place about it. ",2024-08-09 00:30:45,1,1,1,Positive,0.13515625,0,0,2
1ep7b53,university,how would i go about reporting this professor's bad conduct?,"So I’m a graduating senior at my college, and my last two classes were taking over the summer. Unfortunately, I’ve had a really physically and mentally exhausting summer, and my mental health/physical safety had to take precedence over the more workload-heavy course. I was diagnosed with a chronic health condition that has left me in a lot of pain and pretty quickly after that I was fired from my job for not being “productive enough” (it was mostly just ableism). I came close to being homeless more than once and there were some periods where I didn’t eat more than four meals per week. I couldn’t pay my phone bill or my Wi-Fi bill and for a period of time, both were turned off by my providers. In this class, there was an assignment due almost every night, but the course website was set up to be as unintuitive as possible. For example, I would go searching for a discussion forum assignment that was supposed to be due on a Friday and find it hidden in an unopened section with the only access link being through the online grade book. The professor had no sort of reminder system set up, and I ended up missing quite a few assignments simply because I couldn’t track them down or because they wouldn’t be listed under that specific date on the website. I ended up having to beg for quizzes to be reopened, and turned in my final paper a day and a half late because I simply did not have access to the internet to submit it. When I realized that my grade was still pretty low, I panicked. I hadn’t applied for financial aid for the upcoming year because I was supposed to already be done, and I felt like a POS for having to ask for pity points, but that was the only avenue available if I wanted to graduate. In response, I got about 1000 words claiming that I had “harassed” him for extra points (we had maybe 3 email chains over the course of 5 weeks, and I had only asked for one alternative assignment in that entire time period after realizing that I had missed discussion posts) and that if it were up to him I wouldn’t graduate at all. If he were any other professor, I would have immediately forwarded the email to his chair and let the situation take its course out of my hands. However, he is the director of graduate studies in the department that I’m supposed to be returning to for grad school in a year. I don’t know if there IS anyone above him in the metaphorical food chain, and now I’m worried that if I do come back for grad school, I’ll be treated differently because of his status as the director. I feel like my hands are tied.

Also, I do not believe that I automatically deserve more leeway than other students, but he has been consistently passive aggressive and unkind toward me and before I could even be given the opportunity to explain my situation and why I hadn’t been as active as I wanted to be, he insulted my character and implied that I was stupid. Regardless of whether or not I “deserve” another chance in his class, no student deserves to be bullied by their professor.",2024-08-11 00:10:14,1,4,1,Negative,-0.009338061465721033,0,0,0
1dslz28,university,Unsure of Path and Major (Health Centered) (Long Post),"Hello, I am an incoming freshman, 17F, this coming Fall 2024 semester to my university and am currently majoring in Biology (B.S.). Since mid-junior year of high school, I had been saying I would become a pharmacist. I have always wanted to do something in health as the human body has always interested me. I also really enjoyed math (mostly algebra and trig) throughout school. Being a pharmacist seemed to have a great salary, was math and science driven, was on the health path and seemed sort of mundane but fitting to my personality because I like routine and nothing too scattered and I would like to be able to help others. I also looked into becoming a pharmacologist but I'm really not a fan of researching and all of that. I've pretty much kept this thought process of becoming a pharmacist through the rest of high school and did not really delve into the idea of other career paths because this one seemed comfortable and like something I could complete. I also felt a little pressured to decide something early on so I wouldn't have to deal with the pressure of deciding in uni. ""Major in Biology, finish prereqs, apply to the PharmD program, get accepted and complete it, and become a pharmacist who works at like a Walgreens pharmacy or a hospital"" was pretty much the plan. 

But recently, I had been having some doubts on this pharmacy plan that I am planning to go on and feel as though it may not be 100% for me. While I do see myself satisfied with this path, a part of me feels as though I have been putting myself in a box and that I have not allowed myself to explore other career options in health. While I know that I can complete the PharmD program, what if I end up hating becoming a pharmacist in the end. I know that pharmacy is Chem heavy, and I've been told that if you don't love chemistry, pharmacy might not be for you. While I am decent a chem, I don't love it. I've always been more of a Bio and math person. I have also heard that being a bio major isn't that competitive for PharmD school because many people do it, so I've also become unsure about my major. 

My uni has pre-health advisors (that I will talk to) that deal with health career paths such as pharmacy, physician assistant, MD, optometrists, PT, etc. I feel like I should just remain undeclared and claim 'pre-health' because then I can figure out what health career path I want to go on instead of being fully decided or having to completely throw the pharmacy path out the window. The idea of not being completely decided kind of scares me though. One thing that is also bothering me is my major.

  
Should I become a public health or health science major on the 'prehealth track' which would kind of stand out more when applying to programs and schools later on?

  
Stay as a Biology major on the 'prehealth track' which stands out less but matches up well with the rest of the prereqs I would need for prehealth?

  
Stay as a Biology major and go into PharmD program?

  
For the first 2, pharmacy is not completely out the window, I just feel like it would give me more room to explore other health paths. And who knows, I might end up deciding on the pharm route.



Also if you know anything other ways that I could explore others paths, can explain more about what its like to be a specific type of pharmacist, or have any  other health career path ideas that seem like they fit me that make over six figures, that would be very helpful! Thank you!!",2024-07-01 06:15:55,1,0,1,Positive,0.18564778645833332,0,0,2

1em08fw,careeradvice,"Quitting job after 8 months, but boss wants me to stay. Any advice?","
I emailed my resignation letter to my boss today, and during our meeting he expressed he really wants me to stay, and to reconsider leaving. I have nothing bad to say about the people, but my main issue is the role I’m in and what that entails (dispatching coordinator for a corporate, power company). I’ve been in this role for 8 months and been stressed for the last 7. My stressors may be alleviated in the next few months (adding more resources to team, etc) but I really don’t know if I could hold out for that long. He says I’ve done such a great job so far and the account managers I work under have always had good things to say about me. We’re already short staffed as it is and I feel guilty about leaving, especially since the people in the office are nice to work with. 

I do have another job lined up, for a small family owned business and the manager understood I was coming from a workplace filled with stress and she reiterated I would not have as many responsibilities in this new workplace. A chill, “boring” job is what I was looking for in this recent job search and it sounds like this would be it

Has anyone let guilt take over and stay at a job for the people, pushed through the rough patches, and for the potential of things getting better? Or did you go with your new job offer?

1ej6we0,careeradvice,Am I wrong to leave at a terrible time for my team?,"I work on a small team of 10-20 people. Up until recently, there were 3 of us doing my particular job (let's call my coworkers Mike and Kyle). It's a very important job to the team that I'm on, as 5-10 of our other coworkers rely on us to do our work. I've been told by management that the team could not function without Mike, Kyle and I doing our jobs. Mike is expecting a child soon, so everyone was bracing for the team to be understaffed and for me and Kyle to carry the load for a couple months while Mike is on paternity leave.

A few weeks ago, I came across a job opportunity that was very attractive to me. I applied to the job, and started the interview process. The interview process seemed to be going well, and I was looking forward to taking the next step of my career. I am expecting an offer in the next couple of weeks.

Now here's the kicker: last week, Kyle suddenly left for a different company. This was completely unrelated to me pursuing my own job opportunity, and I had no idea that Kyle was even interviewing elsewhere at all. So now the team is panicking because we lost Kyle permanently, leaving just Mike and I to shoulder the work that was done by Mike, Kyle, and I. And since Mike is going on paternity leave soon, the team is expecting for me to carry the burden on my own. Management is scrambling now to hire a replacement for Kyle and get me help. They have put up job postings to fill that gap.

No one has any idea that I'm about to leave also. So now, I will look like an enormous asshole when I drop the bomb that I am leaving too. This will only leave Mike to shoulder the burden for a short time, and then he will go on paternity leave and there will be no one left to do our job while he's gone. I have no idea what the team would do. It is making me lose so much sleep and giving me a ton of anxiety because I feel like I am letting my team down. I am so worried that me leaving might lead to management laying off people because they no longer have the support of Kyle, Mike, and myself.

I feel absolutely awful because I feel like I will be screwing my coworkers, but this is a rare opportunity that I don't know if I will get again. I'm trying to rationalize that it's not my fault that management didn't hire backups to do our jobs, they chose to risk it by running lean for a while and only have 3 people do it. I had been asking for almost a year at this point if we were going to hire a 4th, only for them to prioritize hiring elsewhere. Also, the timing is awful but it's not my fault that Kyle left right before I am, and that M is going on paternity leave right after. I also try to remind myself that the working world in America is ruthless and that my company would cut me in a heartbeat if there were layoffs. 

So do I owe them any loyalty if I know that if shit hit the fan, they would show me none? Am I in the wrong for leaving now and pursuing this great opportunity?

tl;dr I am leaving my job at a time that would be screwing my team due to lack of resources. Is this the wrong thing to do?",2024-08-03 16:05:23,35,34,1,Negative,-0.045877305877305874,0,0,0

177abqp,students,Should I report a Professor for Misconduct?,"During this week, I encountered a situation involving one of my professors. In previous interactions with my professors, I have requested that content warnings be provided when material involving sexual violence is included in the curriculum, particularly in the context of film presentations. Firstly, it allows me to prepare for the content mentally, eliminating the element of surprise. Secondly, it lets me take any necessary anxiety medication, facilitating a more composed experience. This also aids in averting panic attacks.  
However, during the week mentioned above, the professor failed to issue a warning for a film screening not included in the school syllabus, catching me unawares. Approximately one-third of the way into the film, I began to experience a severe panic attack characterized by physical paralysis in my legs and arms, intense constriction in my neck and shoulders, blurred vision, and cognitive impairment. My initial instinct was to leave the classroom, but my physical state prevented me from doing so.  
It took approximately 20 minutes for me to summon the courage to exit the room and seek solace in the hallway, where I remained for approximately two-thirds of the movie's duration. Upon returning to the classroom, my professor solicited the students' opinions on the film and, to my discomfort, singled me out on multiple occasions. I verbally expressed my unease and suggested he ask someone else for their perspective, as I did not have a favorable view of the film. In response, he commented that he valued the opinions of students who adhered to a politically correct viewpoint. This comment prompted an emotional response from me.  
Subsequently, I felt compelled to remind him that I had requested a content warning, and he had chosen to disregard it. Overwhelmed and pressured to respond, I exited the classroom in tears. My professor followed me and attempted to place his hand on my shoulder as I hurried away. He later sent an apology email and continued to single me out after the incident. His apology said all the right words and was well-composed. That wasn’t the problem; it was the fact he singled me out in my class when I was showing apparent discomfort and continued to push for an answer five times back to back.  
I'm pondering whether or not I should file a report. I genuinely appreciate the professor and the class, and I wouldn't want to introduce any tension into the wonderful learning environment it offers. Nevertheless, I've been feeling uneasy in the aftermath of this incident for the past three days. Additionally, the professor's decision to single me out in the email has led me to believe that my peers are discussing the matter.",2023-10-13 22:16:35,0,1,1,Positive,0.051298701298701295,0,0,2

1d6yf53,academia,I quit/turned down two PhD positions before my current PhD. Will this haunt me in faculty job searches? ,"I am currently an early PhD student in a STEM program (fundamental science) in the US, and am thinking of applying for postdocs and faculty positions in the future. 

A few years ago, I completed my masters from the UK and had accepted a PhD position there with a young faculty who was just setting up their lab. We were quite close but in the end I couldn’t do my PhD in the UK due to family reasons. I told them I won’t be able to do my phd with them and moved to the US to do my PhD at a top school in the Midwest. 

I ended up not finding a lab for few months and was a bit stressed as all my peers had a lab by then. So I decided to apply again while waiting to find a lab. In the end I did find a lab and started working there. Later, however, I decided I am too far away from family and the US is massive. So I quit the program and moved to be with family. My prof was supportive. But my labmates there were quite toxic so I haven’t been in contact with them (or the prof) since then. 

I took some time off that summer and in the end decided to continue my PhD journey at one of the schools closer to my family in the US. Things have been going really well in my current program and I am quite happy with everything. 

Now, I am thinking about my future in academia and I am worried that I may have actually burnt bridges in my journey and it would haunt me during the job search.

1erkuuk,careeradvice,Do I let the anxiety win? ,"Hey all,

  
So I've worked jobs with some what ""none traditional"" work settings. I work with my family from High School through College. We own a restaurant so I was offered luxuries such has hours/days off. After graduating College I started working as a Case Worker for the local mental health authority. It was hybrid so I started and ended my days from home and all my appointments were in the community. I was never in the office. After 4 years I began working as a College advisor. This was going to be my 1st traditional be at the office 8-5 job but the pandemic happened so I worked remote/hybrid for 3 years. In 2023 we started going to the office full time. My anxiety has been crazy and now I'm considering leaving. I don't like the job all that much. I do really want to leave but I'm afraid I won't find something in the same salary rage. I have a savings and have already identified areas I can cut back so I know I'll be ok financially. I have also started applying for remote jobs. I've been out on FMLA for 12 weeks and it's time to go back but I'm strongly considering not going back. I don't want to let the anxiety win but I also don't feel fulfilled and I don't see anymore opportunities to grow with the company right now. Resigning makes me feel like I'm failing even if its for good reasons. Any advise? Thanks for reading.



PS: I'm 33/M. I have a BA in Psychology and a BS in Health and Human Performance. Single, no kids. Just me and my pup so this decision doesn't impact anyone but me.       ",2024-08-13 22:26:48,1,3,1,Positive,0.13683150183150183,0,0,2

I am desperate.

At my work I get very overwhelmed and said something I should not have said. It was not the worst thing in the world, but it was enough to make at least one person very mad at me. (it was nothing offensive, nothing bigoted in anyway)

Due to this I have been placed on leave.

I am going to therapy to try to get better at managing my stress/not getting overwhelmed. I'm worried it is not working.

I love this job. It is all I have wanted for years. I am so worried I am going to lose it. And if that happens I will never be able to work in a job like this again.

I am honestly scared I might try to kill myself if that happens.

This is my LIFE.

I NEED to get better. I NEED to change. But I don't seem to be able to.

Does anyone have any advice? Any place I can go?

1dguofq,stress,"Update on my symptoms don’t know if I should be concerned if I have gastroparesis, mcas, gallbladder, h pylori etc or if it’s all just from stress? Also noticed few petechiaes on my arms","Today: I’m free from having diarrhea or stomach pains but I still have to be very careful what I eat as I feel most foods cause acid reflux making me feel pressure or as if I have a lump in my throat and crazy belch burping and I still get gassy at times or even burning in my stomach. Some food make me have to use the bathroom right away and everytime I have a bm I get crazy cramps. I see when taking Zantac and antidepressants symptoms ease down also see when my anxiety is lower or once it’s night time and I’m laying in a dark room symptoms are not as bad. I got my period which is causing me to feel a bit of my stomach pains and all symptoms a bit more also I notice during this period I have many blood clots. Lastly don’t know if it’s from taking Zantac and clonazepam so often that I notice a few petechiaes on both my arms like 3-4 each side space out. Don’t know if this is all from stress ever since this started I’m scared 24/7 that I’m going to end up in the hospital or die besides having to deal with other stressful things in my life and vertigo 

Week  ago: went to the bathroom mushy and almost diarrhea twice, I did eat cooked carrots last night had mircogreens with salmon for breakfast and less then a spoonful of yogurt, don’t know if that’s why I’m going like that today. As of right now really no stomach pain 

Yesterday: Woke up belch burping like crazy but had no pain in stomach just gassy at times, could eat more today but notice for awhile now I get acid reflux and depending on the food could be worse and only time I feel some pain is when I feel above my belly button when I press in I get a weird  dull pain then it fades away. Overall I’m belch burping a lot and having lots of acid reflux and burning in stomach on and off. I could burp for an hour straight even without eating anything. I know my period is due in a few but I’m concerned I could have h pylori or stomach cancer. I saw many young people have stomach cancer in their 20s

Other day: still belching not as gassy in the moment, above belly button still feels a bit weird but pain went away and toward the left side a bit feels like a balloon at times then I belch and feel better. Overall don’t feel as bad as last night under belly button it is sensitive to touch a bit. Have burning in stomach after eating 

Yesterday: Was feeling better even had somewhat of a normal bowel movement, later on I pressed right above my belly button going a little bit to the left and I got a dull burning pain going up a bit and around belly button and now it hasn’t left and I can’t stop belch burping again. I have been taking Zantac and it has been helping me keeping that pain bloated gas feeling away but not so much today maybe it’s also because I took ibuprofen and also I do not have a fever but my period is due in 8 days. Basically it feels like someone punch me in the stomach now 

Say before: stomach feels kinda better today, went to the bathroom felt like I had a wall on the side of my rectum with sharp pain went very small stool and sorry for the tmi but it smelled horrible, besides that my face has been feeling flushed took my temperature and it’s between 100- 99.7 I’ve been highly stressed and my vertigo has been really bad today. Stomach overall as I said feels a bit better but kinda also feels like someone has punched me in my stomach/lower abdomen 

Few days ago: Light sharp pain around my belly button that goes down to my uterus (kinda) and light pain around the belly button especially when pushing down around my belly button it feels funny weird light sharp pain and lower stomach pain area. Pressing around the area feels sensitive hurts a bit near my hips down, gassy and feeling slightly better after burping also symptoms could act up more after eating or when feeling more anxious. Took Zantac last night helped me a bit
 
Female/24, Back in January I’m not sure if I had a stomach bug or after years my ibs came back but for like two months I couldn’t really eat and belch burp a lot, after sometime it all kinda went away but my bathroom habits i noticed kinda changed. Recently few weeks ago I came down with a cold and was taking a lot of honey which I think cause me to get a flare up again with ibs and I was also extremely nervous under a lot of stress due to personal reasons, was constipated then started to go more normal once I added more veggies into my diet but I started having to be careful what I ate as I would have to run to the bathroom or start burping like crazy then last Sunday I felt everything kind of calmed down til Monday morning where I woke up feeling fine went to go eat some left over zucchini and within an hour I started to burp like crazy and have really bad cramps and kept going to the bathroom floating stools with watery D. also got a hive. Since Monday I have not been the same I can’t eat can’t even have water just some gatorade everything makes me burp like crazy for hours gives me lots of gas and hurts my stomach. Basically the gas, burping nonstop, and diarrhea/floating stools are back. I did feel like a band wrapped around my tummy whenever I ate something other then rice and some soreness in the right upper side of my stomach there the other day but I also did do a workout that did and haven’t felt anything today, also had some light pain that would go into my back for a bit but that stop as well.. right side has always stick out been bigger then the other side of my upper stomach for years. I know that I’ve been having a lot of stevia in my stuff recently and I just ovulated yesterday lastly I deal with vertigo and back attacks that put my body in fear mode overall I do have a very nervous stomach and all the pains feel like gas pains

5 months before the exam, I kept telling myself to actually start digging in with my papers and do just minimal studying but somewhere inside also believed I will ultimately forget everything if started now plus it would also consume my time given that I am a college student.

Fast forward to 1 month before the exams, I was so stressed out to a point where I would just look at the papers and felt like all my brain cells were at a vacation. 

This continued till last night, the night before the exams, I tried going to bed early as I believed no amount of studying would help me anymore.

I tried tucking myself at 1:00am but it was hell. I never got to sleep until 6:00am in the morning. During the time I wasn't able to sleep, the hellish 4 hours was more like seeing all the shit in my life up to this point and the most heartbreaking realization was I'm probably gonna make another one tomorrow.

The moment I arrived at the test center, everything was just spinning, I can clearly see my peers enjoying their 7 hours of sleep and saying that the exam was somewhat manageable.

It broke my heart knowing that I really struggled and had so many mistakes. Now I feel horrible, for someone who doesn't post anything, this is a very desperate move.

1erpi8r,careeradvice,Proceed with temp job or take permanent? ,"Hi, I work for a temp agency and they have kept me employed for quite a while. I'm on a new contract in the same company but a different department. I love this new department as I came from a call center in the previous department. This new one is more laid back, no excessive time watching/keeping, no micromanaging, not a lot of meetings, and most of all no dealing with customers on the phone…just all projects and I'm learning a great deal. It is such a nice change and has lessened my stress and anxiety, which I desperately needed.

The problem is the previous department now has a full time permanent position available and before my contract ended, the management assured me they would let me know when an opening is available. Well they did and I got several of teams messages with everyone wanting me to come back. However, I really don't think I want to, but at the same time, l would be a fool not to take a permanent job with benefits, I guess, right?

My last mind was to not apply, as my current contract I have many months left on it and in the interim, my plan was to get certification in another field I have experience in and then look for permanent work in that field Yet, we know how life is and things don’t always go planned.

I submitted an application at the last minute for the permanent role out of guilt, feeling pressured and anxiousness and thinking I'd be ungrateful after that team pushed for me to get hired on. However, now I want to back out. I dread having to go back. It's not necessarily horrible and toxic but not anything I want to go back to. I really really want to stay on the team I'm with, it’s a better fit for me but it's not permanent. I've quite anxious going back and forth deciding what to do.

* We've been in the process of integrating our businesses ever since. My company became a BU for a specific product and it was finally decided that my department would be absorbed by the parent company. My team is will start onboarding in less than two weeks from now.
* New bosses, new processes, new squads, new clients, new coworkers. We're going from a 3 people (formerly 4) team to a 45+ people team with a completely different structure. Nobody know how things will play out for sure, yet.

Now, about me:

* I'm an intern. In my country this means that I work part-time (30hrs/week), get paid a minimum wage but am not legally binded to my employer like a full-time employee.
* I've been at this job for 1 year and have 15mo of work-experience in my field.
* Besides general positive feedback, I've received the following from my coworkers: ""You finish work as quickly as we do"", ""You're an intern, but your skill level is above that of a regular intern, which surprised me a lot"", ""When you got here you were already well developed for the work experience you had"", ""When I started as an intern I wasn't able to do as much stuff as you"".
* I'm very good with my deadlines and my work output almost matches that of my coworkers, even though I work 2hrs less/day. The quality is pretty even.
* I've developed skills for this job (ex: basic HTML/CSS coding) and I'm already ahead of my peers regarding some of them. This is, I learn very fast (have received this feedback from my lead).
* I'm starting to get impatient as I earn less than my coworkers while I'm doing very good regularly.

Now, both of my coworkers have more work experience than me, but I still feel like I could push for a promotion to full-time employee. I want to use the department transfer as an opportunity to do very well and stand out from my coworkers. Kind of taking advantage of a ""leveled playing field"".

I'm also going to be the only intern for our line of work in the new company, and I'm dreading being left to do simple, short activities while right now I do everything, including more complex stuff, like my coworkers do.

How should I go about this? Do you have any tips or general advice?",2024-08-08 19:50:26,1,0,1,Positive,0.1481099751312517,1,0,2
1er0uj3,college,"Scared, stressed and haven’t even started yet.","Today was move in day. The rest of this week is basically just freshman orientation and stuff (Mambo, since I’m at the University of New Orleans.) Unfortunately thought, due to transportation issues and finances just being really tight right now, I won’t be moving in until this Sunday due to not having any of my dorm supplies yet and by it being the only time my older brother (lives close to campus) is able to pick me up and drop me off if my stepdad isn’t available to take me instead. From the looks of it I still have holds on my Workday account even though I’ve completed everything for FAFSA (loan entrance counseling, promissory note n stuff), so I’m not even sure if I’ll be able to register for classes since they’re what stopped me from registering sooner. I was able to attend the first day of orientation and finally got a feel for what the campus looks like in-person, but I don’t know for sure if I’ll be able to get my grandmother (who’s also super close to campus) to bring me at any point in the week since it’s roughly a 30-minute drive both here and back and I’m not really sure what her schedule is like. I’ve been trying not to stress out too much about it but I’m really scared that by the time I get there, any opportunities I have to make friends will be mostly gone and I’ll be stuck being just as lonely as I was in high school, on top of just generally being behind on everything that I’m supposed to learn before classes start. I’m sorry if I sound whiny or something since I feel like a good chunk of it is likely my fault, but I just felt like posting here would give me some type of outlet to let go of this stuff without either stressing my mom out or being told not to worry too much even though that is LITERALLY all I feel like I can do right now.

1c796op,stress,Stress or something more serious ,"I am worried about myself and have been since last May . It all started when I was at a job that I thought I loved but ended up too stressful for me . I thought I could handle it but I couldn't . I made the mistake of being overly independent instead of asking for help at work or home I did things myself which caused problems in my relationships. I had a coworker at first that I thought we got along but things escalated when my good supervisor left but now I'm starting to see why . My coworker decided to get belligerent with me when no management was around. She would fight me, think company policies were stupid didn't want to follow my direction.  She would leave the room when we worked in a medical setting , didn't communicate she was leaving which caused a safety issue to those In our care. She even told me she didn't like to be told things by someone in authority and she was older . Come to find out management failed to let me know her true job description, which could have prevented my poor job performance which was odd because i got previously promoted not to mention or prevent undue stress. I would go home upset to the point of tears. The tension got worse, I got coached and eventually terminated.. new Manager was blind to what was going on and get upset at me . I felt I was wronged and I took the job loss hard . Around the same time , my mom was back in my life which Ive had a traumatic life because of her and other things , she needed my help which caused me more stress, moved in with my husband and I ended up lying to us then she was out of the picture again. I've been trying to take care of myself, wanting to get pregnant, having fights with my husband because I can nag or I get hit with things that affect my mood etc I don't want him to think I'm constantly unhappy or have issues. I went through a period where I nagged him we almost got divorced and the last thing I want to do is lose him because without him I'm literally a nobody. We got a dog that ended up needing a new home due to being hyper that caused me to be stressed. We had a pest problem but got better thought that was because of me. Felt I was going through menopause that caused me to be depressed.  Was worried about losing my husband. Had a family emergency, my job at first thought was being inconsiderate but later it appeared they weren't .I was going through crying spells, felt my heart was going to stop. Had periods then skipped a month now I'm back on track it seems..want to open up but don't know how . Feel people think the worse of me and that I'll take my husband down. Wanting to get close to my in laws but so afraid they will leave me or hate me. Concerned about my husband he's all I have. A best friend betraying me, feeling I dint matter and if I speak up I'm selfish,or afraid I'll be dishonest.  Don't want to lose my husband, miss my sex drive my love for life . We haven't had a vacation or a night overnight somewhere in a while just to get away . Lately I've been hsving gas, neck pain, other strange sensations and worried I'm dying or have cancer or will have a heart attack. I want to tell people how I feel but dint want to be a burden or lose more people.. I am worried about my weight too I don't eat alot of food but still feel really bad about myself and weight . I want to know what's going on stress anxiety or hormones.. like today i feel really bad about myself . I hope it's safe here . 
Am I just under severe stress which doesn't help what I've already been through. I'm. Just scared something is wrong has anyone felt like this ? 

Tldr; really struggling 41 yo f wondering what's wrong. Been hsving life events such as wanting to get pregnant, job loss , family issues concerned about health. Afraid I'm dying. Trying to figure out of stress, or something else . Worried about myself, hope someone can help ",2024-04-18 17:30:02,3,4,1,Negative,-0.05934786461102251,0,0,0
1djbeqj,university,Stressed about my workload and completing my degree. Advice? ,"I’m a second year studying Bachlors of criminal justice. 

I take solely online courses which I find saves me time of driving to my lectures, sitting for 3 hours (my uni does 1x lecture a week 3x hours) and instead I have heavy readings and 30-2 hour lectures. 

I’ve been taking 3-4 courses a semester currently but it’s my understanding the required work load is 5x a semester to graduate within the 4 years. 

I don’t want to take 5 years. I know that’s pretty common but I’m worried.

I currently got a pretty well paid job doing 9-1-1 call taking with the federal police. As someone who’s studying criminal justice working with the police is huge for my career. 

My counsellor said I can challenge my practicum with 18 months logged at this job they could possibly let me do this, which is huge as it’s 700 hours they require total for my practicums. 

I work 4 12 hour shifts at work, providing me 4 days off. I work 2 night shifts. I do have time to go on my phone, read or do other things. My lunch is 1 hour and 15 minutes. When I’m at work I may be able to do some readings or light work but I can’t rely on that because if it gets busy I need to shut down and pay attention since it’s life or death. 

I have a lot going on in my personal life. I know my current federal policing job has so many opportunities when I’m done my degree-high paying and willing to take me as I’m already employed. 

I do want to go to grad school as well. I’m just worried about spending my entire 20s studying into my 30s. Is it worth it?

1eskgo2,college, Concerned my ADHD will interfere with my future college life and unsure of where to even start financial/academic wise,"Not really sure how to start this post or smoothly segue into my main concern, so I guess I'll just get to the point: 

I'm a senior in high school this year and expect to graduate in May. Although I look forward to it, the idea of what will happen after and college is petrifying and divisive for me.

On one hand, I wanna go to college and at least go somewhere and pursue (at the very least) an associate's degree. I love learning and am a huge nerd about science and anything in the art field and would like to do something with that. Both in college, and in the work force. 

Yet, on the other hand, I'm horrified of what to expect if I were to go somewhere for college. For more context (you read the title, but still): I have ADHD (and autism) and am worried it'll affect the way I learn. I struggle so much with executive function and although I like to learn, I hate doing it on school time and would much rather pace my own learning.

Another major concern I have is knowing what to choose + how I'm gonna be able to afford everything. I know there's opportunity funds and assistances you can apply for, but I'm not even sure where to start with that because I don't know what college to start at. I have a job and have been putting at least half of my check into savings per week to at least give myself some support, but Idk. 

I guess what I'm getting at is: People here who either are in college or graduated that are neurodivergent, how do/did you manage everything? And to anyone here in general, how did you get over your financial/academic fear(s) and what advice do you have for someone in my position? Anything helps

1e74vdn,university,I can't decide between Science and Arts,"Hello. 
Quite frankly speaking, I am stuck when it comes to choosing a degree. 

I am highly proficient in music. I have always been a natural at understanding rhythms, sounds, songs, etc. It's always just come easily to me and many people have praised my talents. My music teachers have described me as a prodigy. 

I have my Grade 8 in piano and I play drums and vocals too. I love music, I really do. But I have no idea what I'd do within the field. 

I've just completed a 1 year course in Sound Engineering, and am going on to do another year in Advanced Audio Visual Media. But after that... I have no clue. I hope after this coking academic year I have a better sense of direction, but who knows. 

Since I was a child I had dreamed of being an aeronautical engineer, but that dream quickly faded when I realised how bad I was at the likes of naturally understanding applied mathematics and engineering. My peers who were proficient in it, had the equivalent natural understanding of technology as I had to music, and i am so envious of that. 

I adore science. My high school subjects consisted of Chemistry, Physics, Applied Mathematics, Higher Level Mathematics, Accounting and Music. But there isn't necessarily anything specific I would like to do in it, and I'm worried I might only have a fascination for it rather than an proficiency, despite doing extremely well in them in school, except for applied maths. 

I also have a high interest in the environment, as well as plants and mushrooms, and i would love to get to know my natural world better. Climate change and energy efficiency have always been a peek interest of mine too, and have made several efforts in my previous schools to help reduce carbon footprints etc. 

But to be quite honest I have zero direction
I have no idea what I want to do. My extremely vast interests have somewhat prohibited me into finding something and sticking with it. At this point I'm considering doing two degrees, one in music and then one in general science. 

But I feel as if that is foolish. 

Is there anyone else who has been / is in similar shoes? ",2024-07-19 14:18:55,2,3,1,Positive,0.16306451612903225,0,0,2

1ercgs2,stress,How to handle any type of stress for someone who is overly sensitive?,"Hello, I'm 20f, and I graduated around almost 3 years ago from high school. since then, I've tried 3-4 different jobs, and I never lasted more than 2 months because I couldn't handle any stress and was causing me to have anxiety attacks daily. my first job was in high school for the summer, I worked as a cashier at a taco Bueno. I had no love or hate for the job, but it was only for the summer, so even if I didn't like it, I was planning on leaving anyway. my 2nd job was around a few months after graduation, and it was overnight at walmart for stocking. I only lasted 2 days before I quit due to a manager being on my ass from day 1 and yelling at me. a few months went by, and I got a job as a deli employee at a cefco near me. I lasted a month due to the manager making me train new people a week after I started. Some coworkers didn't do their part, so I was basically running the deli on my own. I started having anxiety attacks from the stress, and I would cry from the moment I woke up to the moment I fell asleep. it sounds like im lying, but I really was crying all day long, even during my shift. a year went by, and I found an opening for a janitor for the same walamrt I worked before. it was going great up until the last week I worked, the store manager was being very picky about how clean the store was, and majority of it was overnights job, but they never really did anything. we would tell our managers about coming in and having the bathrooms look like they weren't cleaned since we left that night, and how the closet was alway a mess when I would come in the morning, but nothing ever changed or got done with overnight, so I eventually left and so did 3 other people around the same time I left. Now I'm in therapy, and that's when I found out that I don't respond well to any stress and that I'm more sensitive than I thought. I made a random decision while working at my last job to take a phlebotomy course. it's my last week until next week, when I take my nha exam, but now im starting to stress about my random decision to do this. ""Was I really wanting this or only wanted a way out? will I even enjoy this? how's the stress, I know it's gonna be a lot more than I can handle, so why did I do this?"" these have been some thoughts running through my head since yesterday and I cried this morning bc I feel like no matter what I do, it's always going to cause my to stress because I don't know what I want from myself, and I keep putting/throwing myself at things hoping it would stick, but my head won't stop stressing about any and all decisions I've made. sorry for the long text, but I'm genuinely lost in my own stress, and after years of therapy, I still can't handle it


EDIT: I forgot to say during that year of unemployment I was at home helping my mom with everything since she's been injured for almost a year already, so when it started to affect her, I picked up whatever she needed me to do. so I would wake up. pick my brother up from work (he works overnight), take my sister to college, come back clean for a bit, eat. pick my sister up from college, get groceries, pay bills, get my brother food, come back home clean more, wait for my dad to come home so I could cook, clean again after that, make my brother his lunch for work, take him to work, come back home, clean some more, and stay up for a few hours and sleep. I really enjoyed my time during that period, I felt like there was little to no stress and I felt kinda free. I've told this to many people but I would rather only work 2 or 3 days a week and get less money. than to work 5 days and be stressed about work on my off days but having more money.

1bj6an2,stress,"Stress Ball Advice Needed... Design? Effective for ""sensory overwhelm during screen time""?","Hi! Mildly autistic guy here...

I have the hardest time managing to stay seated for much of a duration, when attempting to watch ANY of my wonderful collections of movies AND BL dramas I already have sitting on my computer. ChatGTP tells me I can call this symptom ""sensory overwhelm during screen time.""  
My tendency (say while watching Lawrence on MSNBC) is to multitask, going off to different screens, doing other tasks, while still listening to the audio. Obviously, this action is impossible during a MOVIE or drama.

So... Stimming anyone (lol)?   

I have the theory that if I have a stress ball in my hands, that squeezing it in alternating hands may just make my brain allow me to not get bored and anxious, by staying seated long enough to at least watch entire scenes, without feeling like I need to STOP the video/drama/BL/movie/series before 5 or 10 minutes have passed. That's my hope and theory, anyway!

My QUESTIONS here, for my fellow autistics is:

1. Have you, yourself TRIED this method?
2. If so, what were the results?
3. DESIGN! Which is better, a

1ekth5b,careeradvice,Taking a pay cut to improve quality of life,"I currently have the opportunity to move into a job that would, seemingly, provide such a vast improvement in my overall quality of life/work-life balance (something I have been longing for but had not yet felt an opportunity was right) but it will inherently come with a significant pay decrease (from ~$85K to about $55K per year)

It’s just myself and my husband and our cost of living is pretty low; we can certainly maintain a secure life on the new salary, but I’ll be “losing” much of our expendable income (no second thoughts for regular $$ dinners, taking vacations, buying some new clothes, a bottle of wine that I want vs. what’s cheap, picking up the tab for friends, feeling like I can donate to whatever charity/cause I want etc)… I’ll also be losing constant stress/anxiety, the feeling that my job is my primary purpose in life, perpetual “Sunday Scaries,” and having no physical/mental/emotional energy to pursue things I WANT to do in the free time that I do have (focus on my physical and mental well-being, my art practice, community building, spending time with aging parents)

I know the things I listed in the first category of “losses” are luxuries and I am hopeful that the gains of more time and less stress are going to be more than fulfilling enough to make up for them, but I’d love to hear from anyone who may have made a similar transition, sacrificing “financial security” for a different (better?) life… thanks to anyone who wants to chime in.",2024-08-05 17:19:22,2,1,1,Positive,0.16912304866850322,0,0,2
1esaa4e,careeradvice,"19M : Burnout, 2yr College ""Dropout"", Starting Fresh in debt","Somewhat of a backstory:
I have done 2 years in university now, during my last year, burnout, coupled with bad coping skills, a lack of motivation and poor mental health directed me towards failing all my courses and letting go of it all. 

It started off by me missing an appointment for my adhd medication, which snowballed into me messing up my schedule, messing up some grades, “coping” then missing my next appointment etc. with the snowball getting larger/worse every cycle. But i doubt that that would be the only cause because no person in their right mind would let everything go.

What did i do during all this time? A combination of sex, drugs (weed, shrooms, nicotine), meditation?, introspection, writing, and just wasting my life away on the internet. (I quit all substances for 3 months now, except weed occasionally)

I have no income and was depending on my parents and student assistance (grants and loans) to fund everything. 

Im currently spending the summer with my family right now, and they do not know about this situation. All they know is that i finished another year of university and now im moving onto the next, technically i could have enrolled into another year, but as i said i let go of it all. I did not enroll in anything this academic year.

I have no “real” work experience as i have never worked before, unless selling miscellaneous items on various marketplaces is considered experience. Just high school education and ~ a year and a half of university credits. I am a very quick learner, but i typically start losing interest as quick as i learn. 

Housing:
Im in Ontario, Canada right now, and the housing and job market is not in the best place for me. 

Staying with my family as an option would probably be the best decision, but the mental stress and shame that comes with it feels like it could crush me. I have a complicated relationship with my parents, and i value freedom above all which i don’t think I’ll have much if i stay there. I also don’t want to set a bad example to my younger brothers, as i don’t want them to think that it is okay to just throw your blessings away. All that or im overthinking it all. If anything, beggars can’t be choosers.

I have friends that would help, but I don’t want to possibly bring them down or add to their “stress” due to my problems. Now that I mentioned it, i also have the same “issue” with my parents, I don’t want to stress them out, but i need to survive.

“Life goal”: 
I see myself creating a multidisciplinary brand centered on avant-garde fashion, music/sound, and design. I know it will be a difficult path to take, but i am willing to take that path as that is the only purpose i see for my existence.

Possible income path:
I enjoy and im passionate about cooking, i have been cooking for years now and i enjoy providing people with good culinary service, would looking into starting a culinary career be a good start? Im willing to start off as a dishwasher and work my way up if it pays the bills.

Finances:
Account(s) balance: $9,850
Debt: -$14,916

:::::: I am aware of and I take responsibility for my past actions. They were bad decisions but whatever happened happened and there’s no changing that, what i could control is the present, and hope for a better future.

:::::: My life goal does sound crazy, which it is, but as long as i have a roof on top of my head, and food on my plate, if i could work on my projects, i will be content. 
    I have a couple plans to start generating some income from it all, but i think it would be a better plan to hold it off until i have some financial stability and an emergency fund, so that i would be able to seek some more aid mentally and hopefully be in a better mental state, as you cant put sugar on shit (build on a bad foundation). That or this paragraph could just be another self fulfilling procrastination prophecy.

I know life does not provide us with tutorials, but i really need some guidance to start out my life.",2024-08-14 19:18:53,1,0,1,Positive,0.06605048500881834,0,0,2
184x2sv,stress,Constantly Stressed,"Does anyone else just feel like nothing can ever make you not stressed ever again? Meditation and any type of mindfulness only helps in the moment I'm doing them, and I go back to being stressed immediately after.

I (28 F) have very little joy in my life, and what I do have is far away (my best friend lives like 200 miles away) or I've lost motivation, energy or interest. I can't concentrate on hobbies for long and I don't really have money that I can spare to ""treat myself"" ot start any hobbies that involve money. Though I wouldn't consider my family bringing me joy, they never visit me, despite only being a bus journey away and I struggle mentally being in their house for a couple of different reasons. And I just don't feel I can talk to them about any mental health stuff.

I also don't have a job because of my mental health and that's one of the things that makes me feel like I'll never have a ""normal"" life.

It just feels like like I am in this constant state of stress and I'm literally having daily headaches to a point where I don't even know what it's like to not have one.

I feel incapable of letting any of the stress I have go and so it festers and manifests. I'm starting to feel like a life without stress is never going to happen.

1es2qnx,careeradvice,I believe I was unjustly fired. Is there anything I can do?,"Hello.

I’m female, 27 (black/native/fat if it matters).

Just giving out full details.

I live in a town called Ardmore, located in Oklahoma, US.

I believe my employment lasted from July 12th - July 18th.

The employer in question was Dairy Queen. Role was team member.

Up until the 18th (my final day of employment), things were going well. I was beginning to be crossed trained in the cooking area.

The 18th rolls around, and my general manager was stressing about the store getting shut down because someone from corporate (district/area manager I believe), was coming in this specific day.

Things are fine, albeit hectic. At the time noticeably overstaffed.

I did a bit of everything that day, custodial, dishes, drive-thru, and finally “blizzard alley” or whatever similar silly name they decided to slap on.

It was hectic! There were two of us to begin with, but as the night went on, and we got busier, we ended up with 5 people in the same area.

A couple of other girls were looking over my shoulder, or idly standing by (since they didn’t get the hang of mixing yet). One even confessed she didn’t know what to do, so I was attempting to help her learn.

I was in the middle of a sundae when the visiting corporate person walks up. Says “Hey you,”

I didn’t immediately look up (it was busy and I was trying to get orders out)

I look up, he says “Hey, you gotta go, you’re fired,” and leaves.

I say nothing, take my gloves off, clock out, and go outside.

I come back inside briefly to ask the GM. “I was wondering why I was fired?”

She actually looked bothered. Whether she actually was I don’t know. She was the one training and looking over me since the beginning of my employment. Never heard a complaint once. She actually liked that I wanted to learn the cooking area.

She replies with a sort of hesitation. A grimace. “Because you were standing around doing nothing…”

“I see.” I turn around, heading back to the main entrance. “I’m sorry,” she says. She seemed genuine about it.

“Not your fault,” I say, not even looking behind me.
And that was the end of that.

For context, when I first started working at this place there were a total of 3 of us (myself, a cook, and the GM herself). Over the next few days she hired about 6-7 more people.

For further context, I hear the place can’t keep employees. About a month or so before I worked there (I had just moved states), my family tells me that there was a mass walkout. All the employees quit the same day.

I was putting in effort. I was working. I was doing my job. Yet despite there being a few (2-3) people who were *literally* doing nothing, I was the only one fired.

Now I’m wondering if there’s anything I can do besides nothing.

Any direction or word of advice is much appreciated. Thank you for your time.",2024-08-14 14:16:28,0,36,1,Positive,0.01702926702926703,0,0,2

Like for eg: uni/studying.  
  
I don't know how much is ""enough"" for the day(s). I feel like I ""have"" to do more, and that I could or ""should"" do ""better"", because I have spare mental energy/time.

It could be due to being indecisive. I don't know how to draw clarity in defining ""enough"" because any target or goal feels arbitrary and I usually have it in me to be able to push through and do more. I end up just working (or overthinking, usually overthinking) myself to exhaustion.

Sorry if post is a bit long, I tried to provide enough detail so that people could provide general advice, but I can elaborate on specifics more if needed.*

**tl;dr form**: I am a 29-year old male living in Massachusetts. I've recently chosen to step away from working as a college professor and want to change career path to college/university student affairs. I am feeling extremely lost on how to find a new job to keep my finances stable while I get the prerequisite education to pursue that path.

**More detail:** I have Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science, and spent the past ~3 years working as a professor of Computer Science. I was unable to adapt to the workload/stress and experienced intense burnout, so I am stepping away for mental health's sake. Through that, I discovered I am passionate about and skilled at working with college students in general. For example, I was credited with reviving our student Computer Science club, and also spent large amounts of time volunteering in our LGBTQ+ Pride Center.

To explore that further, I plan to get a second Master's Degree in Higher Education, with Student Affairs as my long term goal. I'm not currently educated/skilled enough to apply to the vast majority of positions in that umbrella, so I've been feeling extremely lost on what to do for work so that I can afford that degree. I don't know how to kill time until I can do the things I actually want to do for work.

**My Question**: For people who have been in similar situations (changing career path in late 20s/early 30s after Plan A wasn't sustainable), what things did you do to deal with the transitional period? I've been attempting to do a lot of ""informational interviews"" mostly among my own friends/colleagues but not much of it is helping what I do in the short-term aside from further cementing that student affairs is 100% the right long-term goal.",2024-08-02 00:45:19,0,0,1,Positive,0.07690166975881262,0,0,2

I got an ekg done, my heart beat was fine, but my heart rate was at 112\~120 bpm, spiked blood sugar, tight chest, shortness of breath, all that horrible, feeling went to the ER to get more tests done because I wasn't gonna sit down and play some games of (plus it was more than 8 hours at this point):

Is this a potential heart attack or stress related symptom? 

Thankfully, it was stress related, but this leads to my next question. How can I reduce my stress/alleviate this problem before I go to bed and NOT wake up to this?

1es1uip,academia,Stuck in limbo after accepting a TT job offer ,"Long story short, back in March I received an offer from a university, set to start in August. The offer states it’s contingent upon a background check and university approval of the terms we agreed on in the offer letter (including a start-up fund and salary). The college dean signed off on it.

After accepting this offer, I turned down another school’s pending offer and several ongoing interviews. I also relocated to the new city (at my own cost). The university promised to reimburse relocation expenses, but it’s through a reimbursement process.

Since then, I’ve heard nothing for a long time. Over the summer, I repeatedly asked the university about the onboarding progress. They told me the process was delayed due to new procedures being implemented. The dean even emailed me asking if I’d consider postponing my start date to the spring, which I declined.

About a month ago, the university finally started the appointment process, which included submitting a bunch of materials, a background check, and approvals from various levels of the college. However, the process has been extremely slow, and now the semester is about to start, but my appointment is still not finalized. My materials have finally reached the provost’s office a few days ago but there’s been no update since last week.

This has been haunting me for a while, and with the start date literally tomorrow, it’s looking more and more unlikely that I’ll be onboarded in time for classes starting next Monday. I’ve got no idea what to do at this point, and I’m seriously worried about what’s going to happen. ",2024-08-14 13:39:10,26,4,1,Positive,0.0025581906016688585,0,0,2

I had a business partner pushing me hard and I started to feel 6-8 months ago that my work wasn’t as fun. Much because he pushed me and called me when I did something wrong.

In August 2023 I moved and packed all my belongings into 2 bags and moved around Europe 1 month. Started to drink more and sleep less. Still worked out, after that I wanted to go to Cape Town and on the airport I drank 2 glasses of wine and started to feel REALLY dizzy. In the gate to board the plane I couldn’t breathe and thought I got my first panic attack ever.

That disappeared after 2 hours on the plane.

Later when I arrived I felt good.

I woke up the next day, drank a cup of coffee and BOOM the Derelazation hit. I dident feel like myself anymore. I went to bed and played there for 3 days and nothing changed. I got more panic and took the next plane home.

Since then I have had these symtoma coming and going:

- headache in neck and front of head (coming and going)
- depersonalised (24/7)
- fautige
- tinitus (came 2 months ago)
- 1 more hour of sleep per day.
- no motivation for work.
- kinda weak hands / not strong grip. But when I workout I have strong grip.
- health concerns.
- sometimes busy vison / blurry vison.

I have been to the doctor and all my tests are fine / scans. They say it’s most likely stress/anexy/depression.

I eat, workout and sleep well.

I haven’t found anyone else here having similar symptoms, is it even possible for me to burnout when I’m this young?

The real issue is I think being stressed is immeshed with happiness, productivity, and success for me.

16qzlgt,stress,[Serious] My brain and body aren't the same anymore.,"
Hey people!

I really don't know where to start or how to explain my issues, but I'll just give it a go because I could really need some help.  This post will probably be long, so sorry in advance.

Quick presentation : I'm a 28 year old guy who just moved to another city to study at university. I'm a sports guy who have always had a love for sports. Since about 8 years I've been grinding the gym to maybe one day step on a bodybuilding stage (hopefully).

I've had a rough few years since and during the pandemic when it comes to recovery and stress. And even longer before that I've had some issues with other stuff that I'll try to describe.


So: When I was around 19 years old, I got diagnosed with OCD. My life back then was alot of stress and frustration since my OCD took up alot of time by needing to check the oven, doors, oven, water tap for a few hours a day in total. I also had to count to different numbers when it came to checking those things, which is extremely tiring and frustrating when doing it day after day, months and even years.

I started to take meds for depression + OCD for a while, but stopped after a few months because it made me feel weird. I went to CBT for a while, and it helped me with the ''OCD-routines''. But the counting and some other stuff are still here to this day.

During this period (I'm around 21 in the story now) I gained alot of weight, like going from fit to overweight. Maybe I gained around 20-25kg fat.

I then started to exercise around this time aswell, going to the gym. I lost about the weight I gained during a 2-year period and started to feel a bit better.But after this OCD-Period i started noticing I started to become extremely tired and fatigued.I worked at a hospital during this time so there were early mornings for work.I was at the shape of my life during this time but my sleep and my energy levels were extremely low that I couldn't sit in a chair for work because that would make me fall asleep on the spot. I started to noticing the bags under my eyes became more and more darker and more visible.I also started to notice that my brain didn't function as well as it used to. This I noticed by the way my logical thinking was disappearing more and more. I just couldn't think clearly, I couldn't find solutions to simple problem like I used to be able to. My ability to think ''outside the box'' was gone.

Fast forward a few years to the pandemic: During the pandemic my stress went up to a level I didn't know existed. I became a super hypochondriac for about 2 years. My stress was through the roof, and I was so afraid of becoming sick. This stress was so intense everyday, I can't describe it really, but it really took over my life. My body started to respond less and less to my workouts (because of the stress I guess). I couldn't push my body the same way I could before because as soon as I did, I just got sick shortly after. I gained alot of weight around my waist, my brain started to shutdown even more than before. It was like there was no room for nothing else in my brain than stress. I didn't react when a close relative of mine died, because I was so up in my own brain and stress that I just wasn't able to feel anything. My sleep got worse (my sleep has been crap since OCD-period). I've literally not felt rested in the morning since before the OCD-period, but even less now after the pandemic.And my body and brain just isn't the same since after all these years of stress / depression.

These days, I feel like i'm living in a vacuum. I'm just existing.I can't understand what I'm looking at, what I read sometimes, I have a hard time understanding and solving problems. I'm just walking around in life and not being able to comprehend what's going on, on a deeper level.  I feel like my brain works at 10% of what it's capable of. Because I know I was quite ''smart'' before, atleast compared to my current state.  My memory and vision has become like a 90+ year old and my tolerance to stressful situations has become awful.  If something happens, for example when a person is going a little bit too close to the subway tracks, my stress just spikes through the roof and I'm starting to shake and can't speak for about 5 minutes because I'm shaking and can't breath and get words out (sorry for weird example).Another example is when I'm going to talk infront of people, the same happens. I just start to shake, I become very cold and I have problems even saying a single word because I barely can't breath.It's like I've become super-sensitive to stressful situations.I functioned bad before the pandemic, but now after the pandemic, it's just another level.I just seem to not function the way I used to before.

Because of all this, my friends call me ''old man'' because it's like I'm a 28 y/o in a 90+ y/o body.I always wear cap, especially in the morning, to to hide my dark circles. I never look myself in the mirror with the lights on the first hour or so in the morning because it looks like I've been partying and drinking for 2 weeks straight. And for this, when I see myself in the mirror with those dark circles, I shiver in my body because of the disgust of how I look.

The gym and the goal to be a bodybuilder seems to be very far away, but that is one of the things that actually keeps me going, without that my life is extremely gray and boring.The way I write is all over the place, but I'm trying my best in the shortest way possible to describe my issues.I've done evaluation for sleep apnea like 3 times, and they're saying that I sometimes do stop breathing during my sleep, upwards of 1 min+ sometimes, but not to get the diagnose of sleep apnea.I took blood tests before to check my hormones, and they + vitamins were also in decent range, but that was a couple of years so that might be something to do aswell.I've tried alot of supplements to boost my energy etc, but I feel like I need so much more than just a couple of supplements. My waist is also putting on size very easy which is also common when there is high stress.  
I also have a very crappy sleep cycle (staying up late, sometimes to 3am etc)

I just had to get this of my chest, and I would love to hear what you think about my story and what I should do to be able to function again. I'm thankful for every advice in any way, shape or form, even advice for what supplements could also help along with any other advice.I just want my brain and body back!Thanks!/C",2023-09-24 14:51:10,3,14,1,Positive,0.012630093274423179,0,0,2

This is something I've always dreamt of and worked towards achieving, but reality is beginning to sink in and I don't know if its such a good idea. I've always been the type to get homesick / miss family - I find myself crying even at sleepovers, missing my parents and dogs. I'll only be back to my house in India twice a year (Summers and Winters), but for quite long stretches of time (1 month long Winter Break + 3.5 month long Summer Break).

However I haven't even started University yet and am already really scared, any words of advice on how to deal with homesickness as an international student would really help! I've already told myself that I'll be here for 40% of the year and in the US for the other 60% so it mostly evens out + I keep telling myself I only miss things when they're gone. I've had 5 months of no-school (my highschool ended early) to look forward to and prepare myself for this moment, and I thought that I had, but now that it's here I don't know if I can do this.

I'm sure there's many other people in the same position as I am so any help would be really appreciated. I'm incredibly prone to both anxiety and depression and would like to prevent an episode as much as possible. Thanks :)",2024-08-09 03:31:40,18,8,1,Positive,0.13822115384615385,0,0,2

1ebiqhr,stress,I have so much to do and don't know where to turn for advice. ,"I (26f) would ask this in the military spouse subreddit, but there's a couple factors that don't really have anything to do with it.

My husband and I just got married right before he had to go back to his deployment while he was on a visit. We've been engaged for a while and have been planning on getting married for a few years. His deployment kind of came out of nowhere and especially has been hard since it's a year long. We're getting married in the fall right before he's being restationed to Europe. He's honestly the best person I've ever met, kind and caring and loves to take care of me in any way he can. But there's a lot of stuff that he just can't help with because he's deployed, obviously. 

I don't have a great connection with my roommates or parents, and I have one semester of college left. The thing is my final semester would start a month before the wedding and we would have the international move a few weeks after the wedding. I really want to be done with it and I feel like it's taking me entirely too long. However the thought of basically planning the whole wedding by myself and dealing with the move and making sure that I actually graduate (schools always been hard for me, I'm pretty tired) is weighing me down a lot. 

On top of all that, I've been dealing with PCOS for a while and even though I've been taking medications that help me feel good and been working out and eating really healthy for years now, I can't seem to lose any weight. Not only is this a whole self-esteem thing, but I am stressing so much about hating how I look in my wedding photos. I can't really talk to anyone else about this besides my husband and there's only so much he can do and I don't want to stress him out or make him feel guilty for not being here. I've been crying myself to sleep a lot and have no clue how to go about all of this so I've just been procrastinating. 

I moved away from my parents for the summer in with an old friend and even though I really love her she's going through a lot of stuff and just doesn't seem to be able to listen or help at all. It's not her responsibility but I feel kind of alone. I haven't been able to find a job either after a few months of searching. I'm truly wondering if anything will get better and I have no clue what to do to manage all this stress. I've been crying myself to sleep the past week and keep having panic attacks.

1d57s6w,stress,Feeling sick. Is it just stress?,"Hello everyone.

Back in September I suddenly started to feel ill with many different symptoms. It didn't go away for months.

After many tests (all coming back normal) and visits I noticed some patterns (feeling better after visiting the doctor even though he didnt help me in any way). I concentrated on stress management techniques and assumed that all my symptoms were caused by stress.

After just one week I felt almost completely well (this was in February).

Since then I have changed a lot of things in my life, become more active, talked to a psychiatrist, gone to therapy etc.

The thing is that I still have some symptoms and do not feel 100% well:

1. Lower abdomen/stomach area. I feel a slight sharp pain, sometimes on the left, sometimes in the middle. As if someone is poking me with a pen from inside.
2. Pain in the left side of my neck. From my shoulder to my ear.

I have tried anti-inflammatory cream, stretching, changing diet, but it is still there.

Is it possible that it is still caused by stress? Stress that is so much a part of my daily life that I am not even aware of it, but it is still somewhere inside me?

Also, even though I feel much better after assuming that me feeling ill is caused by stress, its still strange to me that Ive fell ill so quickly back in September instead of it being more of a gradual change into illness.

How does this compare with your experiences with stress causing some physical illness in your body?",2024-05-31 22:16:14,3,3,1,Positive,0.03485221674876847,0,0,2
1ck7v1m,academia,University reliance on adjunct labor  negatively impacts student education ,"I am an adjunct lecturer at some very expensive east coast universities.

I did the math today and realized that, at one of the schools, I’m making one third of what ONE student (out of 30-40) pays to take my class for the entire semester.

Obviously, I don’t think I should be making all of or even most of the money earned for that labor. I get how many financial priorities the universities have to juggle, but the very low pay means that I juggle four jobs.

As a result, I’m constantly scatter brained. and stressed. There is so much more I want to do as an instructor as far as creating a more efficient curriculum, grading more quickly, and being more available to students. But it’s hard when I’m just trying to survive financially.

I’m disheartened as I see my department relying, more and more, on adjunct labor and full time jobs becoming almost non-existant, all while admin keeps their seven-figure salaries.

Obviously the reliance on adjunct labor is terrible for adjuncts, but it also hurts students. Good professors can’t sustain living on these tiny wages and leave for other careers. Also, those who stay are so limited in their resources that they aren’t giving their full attention to their students.

I used to think it was worth it to grind for a while in hopes of getting hired full time, but now I’m not sure it is. Which is fine. I’ll get a new job. But I do worry about how the quality of college education will be impacted by universities cheaping out on educators, especially given the cost of college.

Edit: I'm sorry this is common knowledge. I'm first generation, newly graduated,  and nobody warned me, so I'm literally just realizing the extent of the problem now as a new instructor.

Second Edit:  For those curious, the numbers for the cost of attendance where I teach is about 36k for a 15-credit load (2.4k per credit), and I teach a five credit course (a two-credit senior capstone combined with a standard three-credit lecture). As I said, it's a very expensive school. I'd never advise anyone to attend. ",2024-05-04 19:07:15,131,61,1,Positive,0.09268879268879271,0,0,2
193jqra,stress,Burnout / Chronic stress | 22M,"Some background: I’m 22M and 3 years ago I started a few companies. I have been working 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM almost every day. I have worked out slept well and thought I took care of myself.

I had a business partner pushing me hard and I started to feel 6-8 months ago that my work wasn’t as fun. Much because he pushed me and called me when I did something wrong.

In August 2023 I moved and packed all my belongings into 2 bags and moved around Europe 1 month. Started to drink more and sleep less. Still worked out, after that I wanted to go to Cape Town and on the airport I drank 2 glasses of wine and started to feel REALLY dizzy. In the gate to board the plane I couldn’t breathe and thought I got my first panic attack ever.

That disappeared after 2 hours on the plane.

Later when I arrived I felt good.

I woke up the next day, drank a cup of coffee and BOOM the Derelazation hit. I dident feel like myself anymore. I went to bed and played there for 3 days and nothing changed. I got more panic and took the next plane home.

Since then I have had these symtoma coming and going:

- headache in neck and front of head (coming and going)
- depersonalised (24/7)
- fautige
- tinitus (came 2 months ago)
- 1 more hour of sleep per day.
- no motivation for work.
- kinda weak hands / not strong grip. But when I workout I have strong grip.
- health concerns.
- sometimes busy vison / blurry vison.

I have been to the doctor and all my tests are fine / scans. They say it’s most likely stress/anexy/depression.

I eat, workout and sleep well.

I haven’t found anyone else here having similar symptoms, is it even possible for me to burnout when I’m this young?

I would love to get some inputs on this and your thoughts. On this and please tips on recovery.",2024-01-10 21:29:31,8,17,1,Positive,0.1326923076923077,0,0,2

We had a one year old at the time. They both died on ITU and I was an ITU nurse and found it too triggering so I left my job and changed area.  My Dad has BPD and NPD so he was a total disaster and awful after Mum died and we had to worry about him and the inquest. Fell pregnant again, had a difficult pregnancy during COVID which was triggering because everyone on the TV was dying in the same way that my Mum had. Moved house during COVID which was stressful, our cat dropped dead after vomiting blood aged 4 with heart failure. Had baby, when he was 5 months old he became critically ill and we spent 7 months in hospital with him, he had sepsis 6 times  nearly died several times from all the complications of a pancreas tear. I was signed off with stress. Work weren't supportive when I tried to return as I was having panic attacks and needed adjustments made, so I left. That, plus all the time off when baby was sick took its toll financially. Still, the year out of work was the best we have had. Nothing happened, it was bliss.  I finally found a job I could return to and be trained up in and that was an extremely anxiety inducing year, since I was out of work (nursing) for three years by then and it was very stressful to get back into it. Fast forward to this year where my Nan had a stroke and deteriorated and died within 10 days. My Dad dealt with the whole process really badly so I had to step in several times to help her. Around the same time my wonderful father in law got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and is very much end of life now. Which is heartbreaking. And my husband is up helping his family and saying goodbye to his Dad, and I am home with my two young kids and trying to work out how I can manage to work this weekend as we have the smallest support network ever, which is ever-diminishing, and work are putting pressure on me to turn up. They have been really patient in general but also, what do you want me to do?! I'm not a robot and I can't just ignore it all because you're short-staffed?!

'Don't take your anger out on things!I really feel stress.'
and he said 
'Okay but I think its better than hitting my mother.'
I really hate him action and when I always see someone really got angry, I'm kind of trauma. I mean my heart is being fast and be very scared of it.
After that I talked to my mother about reason. why did u be gotten angry.
My mother said 
'Because I forgot turning off AC.'
I asked to her more. Why he really got angry until taking him anger out on things. 
'Then she said because our family haven't money'.
（I think her attitude for him is sometimes bad so he also really got angry too.  ）
Afterthat I really got shocked. I became feeling sorry for to be alive. And cried it was so stressful.
I'm University student and I have a little brother and sister. My little brother is also University student. My little sister is going to go to University too. So our family don't afford to do anything.  Actually me and my little brother student loan about 5 million dollars.

I really really hate and disrespect him and I don't know why did I be born.
He has had this way of being angry with me since I was a little girl.
Cause of this, I'm hate to see someone's very anger if the anger for me.
And I guess he has ADHD because he can't control his anger and he is obsessively particular.

I don't know how to get along with him from now. (I want to ignore him though.)
And I want to know to be relax and get better my

Despite dealing with current ongoing sleep struggles since over 4 months ago, I had a situation on social media that triggered a cascade of emotions, leading to persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety.

Despite gaining closure, these emotions lingered, and I started questioning whether it could be a sign of depression. Intrusive thoughts added to my distress, and there were instances of intense emotions, including sadness, hopelessness, and even thoughts of self-harm.

I experienced a series of stressful incidents, including a family funeral, which intensified these feelings. Sleep issues, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts have become a constant part of my daily life.

i was so focused on finishing i didn't even think what to do when i finish, i wanted to travel but the world was... well in lockdown.  i barley had any savings and i was so afraid to actually start working in any field, and start a career, i was so young (21) i couldnt  actually know what i wanted to work. i even tried a new BA but gave up and now i started my masters. i was so happy to find this program, as if it would fix all my issues and make me happy. i put so much value on this that now that i have started and got accpeted to the thesis track, i wonder if this is worth it. should i put so much more time and energy on getting a MA degree when i can still start to work on my career? and build something for myself?

 i did 6 months in UX design and while i couldn't imagine myself doing this all the time, i did finally feel like i found a career path that COULD be fitting to me. and besides, when i have a career i can fnally save up, and travel more, and feel more free in that sense. i could finish work for the day and just be, do hobbies and relax. in academia the stress is always there to prove yourself. you are never enough. 

i feel like i got sucked into a lie, and while i was planning to do a PHD and start my academia career i fear now this all just happened because i was a young girl afraid of the ""real"" world and parents who supported me more when i studied,  so i stayed where it was comfortable and i just rambled on to the next stop without thinking. i know im brave and capable, ive done amazing things in my life. i am proud of who i am , yet i feel in this specific aspect of my life i failed myself. i did start a masters in a new field and a harder one too, so thats something for pushing boundaries, and i know in the end, career life wont fix me the same academia life won't,and its about growing in life,  but how will i know if i never try?",2024-06-03 07:25:16,16,7,1,Positive,0.18304668304668303,0,0,2

1eok0ty,careeradvice,Should I not tell my employer I am looking for work elsewhere?,"I work at a government job, and recently I received the chance to apply to another job for a substantial pay raise compared to what I am making. My two coworkers just left out of my three man team (one retired after being there 40 years, the other got another job). I am currently training a new person. I never got a raise or a bonus for taking on the extra workload of the other two, plus training a new person. I figured since I was the last of the legacy team I would give my boss the heads up I was applying to this other job and my reasoning for it (my wife and I are starting a family and I really need the money). My last coworker who left was told “congratulations, you have to do what’s best for you.” However when I told them I would apply, explaining I know they can’t match the pay increase (I know, I checked. The only thing in the same payband where I work is a higher level position - the last one was filled by someone with 8 years experience. I have been here 2.5 years. I don’t want to wait 5.5 more years to make what I could make now in this new position) I was told that me telling them that was “very disappointing” and they has put “all their eggs in my basket”. Should I not have let them know I was applying elsewhere? I am worried now they will not be a good reference. And I am extra worried if I don’t get the job I will be given the cold shoulder at work. My manager even said “we will see now that we know you are looking for other work”.

I am wondering if anyone else has dealt with that. Is there a way to repair what I have done and get a good reference? Do people normally not tell their bosses when they are looking for another job? Anyone who has been in a similar position I would appreciate advice, I am worried how work will go next week now that I told them and got a bad reaction.",2024-08-10 04:11:05,0,13,1,Positive,0.04700284090909089,0,0,2

1esct88,careeradvice,Torn on whether to accept an offer,"Hi everyone,

I am super torn on a job offer I've received and would love some outside input.

I am a technical recruiter with 7 years of experience currently working for a mid size tech consulting firm. The technology industry has seen a downturn over the past couple of years, and my current firm has slowed down a lot and gone through a couple of rounds of layoffs. This is what led me to start looking for a new job, however I do feel I have reason to believe my job will be safe for at least the near term. They just reduced our recruiting function in the spring, and things just picked up so we are all feeling busier. I've gotten nothing but positive reviews during my time there and have been told I'm in line for promotion when things pick back up.

I've received an offer to join a civil engineering firm as their first dedicated recruiter. They are a smaller company (400 people to my current firms 10,000) and the role would be onsite 5 days per week vs my current 100% remote job.

The offer is 6k less than I make now, with a salary review in 6 months (their reasoning being that I don't have industry experience). 

I'm struggling to get excited about taking a step back in both pay and flexibility. However, if I decide not to take it and my current company does more layoffs, I'll be kicking myself. This new offer represents the chance to build a process and team, but presents some challenges of working for a smaller company (helping other departments as needed, things like planning the company holiday party, HR/admin work). 

If I take this offer and don't like it, I'm worried it'll be harder for me to interview and land a new job while working in office. My current company has offered good severance and I'm financially stable.

1eri1ci,college,Help - Idk what to do,"TW : Sexual assault, violence, financial problems 

Context : I am a scholarship student and it is vital for my studies: I live 500km from my parents, they are poor so they can't help me, my rent is expensive and my school fees too. I can't change universities because in the one I attended for my first year I was sexually assaulted. I can't look for another university because my professional project is to work in animal agronomy, and this option is only present in the two universities that I tried. 


Which brings me to a problem : in France, scholarships for a 3-year degree are valid for 5 years; I started studying in 2020, but with COVID I dropped out because the professors were sending pdfs and told us ""sort it out yourselves""... so I repeated my first year, which I validated in 2021-2022 (the year I was SA) ; so I went to the other university that offered the option that interested me, but it was very complicated psychologically to go to a university campus, to see new people, being in places with lots of people, etc due to my PTSD.


So I repeated my second year, I've been receiving scholarships for 4 years now (2020-2021, 2021-2022, 2022-2023 and 2023-2024). You will understand that I had additional financial stress... 
The results were published in July and I did not validate any other subject compared to 2022-2023 but my average has increased by 3 points: I am at 9.1/20. I need 10/20 to validate my second year. 
I contacted my degree supervisors to see if they could move me up a year because I would no longer have the scholarships to complete the 3 years of study. But they don't want to know anything because according to them I don't have the level. I tried to make them understand that my grades did not reflect my real level (because I pass distance exams much better (14/20) and that I lack self-confidence because of the assault) but they don't want to know anything, and tell me that it is not with them that I should see for my financial aid. 


Of course, I have psychological and psychiatric follow-up on my campus (free, because I can't afford such things myself in the city) and if I lose my student status I'll no longer benefit from it. So I'm having a really bad summer because I'm really stressed, I'm trying to find lots of other arguments to change the minds of my degree supervisors...I'm really desperate, I don't know what else to say to convince them. The people who are doing my psychological and psychiatric follow-up even wrote letters to my professors to support my statements, saying that I did indeed have PTSD, that I was on the right track to recovery, that I was going to improve, that I had to be trusted so that I would be more sure of myself, etc etc... 


But nothing works, they told me the same thing and added that I had to change my professional projet (even though the projet had been validated by the university's orientation office). 
I am demoralized, I don't know what to do anymore because I worked during my studies and this summer, and even with this money, I can't start my university year without the aid...The teachers don't trust me even though I have the level, I know it because other professors at my old university told me that I was capable of it.


My last resort would be to write a letter to the education prefecture, hierarchically they are above my university managers. But I have little chance of succeeding, because I am so afraid that I am paralyzed, I am afraid of their judgment and I am exhausted from having to tell my sexual assault story to have a minimum of consideration of my teachers and others responsible for my degree... I need your help to help me find other arguments to convince them that I am capable of validating my third year at first try... 


Finally, I apologize for the mistakes (I'm French), for the messy side of my post and for the length of the text... 

Thank you in advance, 
Agathe

178y15e,stress,3 Steps to Reduce Your Stress at Will,"I am a [Buddhist meditation teacher](https://www.freeingourmind.com/)  interested in helping more people reduce their stress and anxiety. I'd like to offer you a simple 3-step process that you can start with.

1. Give your stress level a **number** from 1 to 10,
2. Take 3 **deeper breaths**, making the out-breaths longer than the in-breaths. This has a powerful physiological effect on your stress levels,
3. Notice the level of your stress now. Has it gone down a little bit? Even if you are still stressed, as long as it has moved down even a few decimals of a point, you are doing well. Now **smile to yourself** for a job well done.

Repeat throughout the day.

Even though this technique is very simple, it is very effective. But it is surprisingly easy to forget one of the steps (especially Step #3). Each step is very important for very specific reasons.

If you would like to learn more about the mechanics of this to help you make this a **new habit** in your life, you can read my book 'Get Off Your Cushion: Weaving Meditation into the Fabric of Life' (from your local Amazon store). The first part is especially written to help people reduce their stress and anxiety at will initially, and automatically thereafter. You can also [download a free PDF](https://www.freeingourmind.com/free-pdf) about this 3-step process to get you started.

Try this out and let me know if you have any questions about it. I'll hang around this subreddit for a few days.",2023-10-16 04:45:18,4,0,1,Positive,0.14254524410774408,0,0,2
1eiiznh,careeradvice,Corporate Burnout - Depression,"I am an immigrant in the US working on H1B visa and have been for 7 years after studying here. During the second year of the pandemic I may have fallen into depression; I say may because I wasn't aware of the signs and convinced myself I was just lazy. Later, when things didn't improve I had some sessions of counselling with no success. After moving here I have been noticing a steady decline in my mental health and it has reached a point where I find it difficult to work with focus and drive. The academically and otherwise driven student/person in me has died and absolutely nothing makes sense anymore to me. I have zero interest in even waking up everyday. 



When it got to a point where I realized I need help I started therapy again. It has been a few sessions and my therapist suggested that I am going through a burnout and it could lead to a breakdown sooner or later if I don't take a break from this country and work. It wasn't something that I hadn't thought of. I had been pushing that plan aside considering the general situation of the job market here and the possibility of losing my job if I stay away from here for long, especially since I am not a citizen of this country. My boss is a considerate man and had supported me when I wanted to take a few days off to stabilize my mental health due to the mini breakdown I had, pre-therapy. 

  
Any opinions on taking short term disability leave and going away for at least a month? Has anyone done that before with zero consequences? Or is there any other way I can be better? Can I actually afford to treat myself to this break without the imminent danger of losing my job and my place in my team? I work in one of the top design consulting firms in the word. Any advice is appreciated. I really want to reclaim my old self and come back to work replenished after spending some quiet days with my mom back home.

Lately I've been so stressed that I've barely been able to function right. I have so many different things I have to worry about and not enough time or energy to deal with them. In January I convinced my parents to let my best friend move in with us to escape his abusive family, and that's around when things got bad. He's struggled with rent ever since he moved in because he made poor spending choices, he was eating a lot of our food thank god he got better on that, and he hasn't helped with chores much. Everything that he does wrong, my parents pin the responsibility on me, since I wanted him to move in. So they constantly are yelling at me about him as well as everything I do wrong. On top of that he just got fired from his job, and rent is due in a week 555$ (it's 2 months rent plus extra for being late) and he only has 100$ currently. His parents told him he's not allowed back in their home, so if he can't pay rent he's on the streets. Since I was the one who brought him into my home it feels like my responsibility to help him make the money to keep him off the streets. Which means selling my personal belongings to a pawn shop, since I can't find a job that will hire me (I've been looking since November, it's hard cause I can't drive.) On top of that, we were staying in the basement because my bedroom floor was moldy under my bed because I have excessive night sweats that we didn't know about until after the mold was there, and I was sleeping on a toddler mattress and he was on an air mattress with a small hole in it, and it was okay, not pleasant but I was surviving, but then we made a stupid decision to break my dad's rule of no eating in the basement and now they're making us move back into my old room, even though I haven't been able to finish killing all the mold. I'm struggling in school, falling behind on my assignments, I'm dealing with a lot of dysphoria because of the whole trans thing, my relationship with my parents is getting worse, I'm stressed about an upcoming surgery on my foot that I need to lose at least 30 pounds before I can do it, I have to make money for my best friend's rent, I have to find a job so I can afford rent when I graduate in a few months, I have to finish fixing my room asap, I have to move all my belongings and furniture back upstairs into my room, I've got 3 big projects I have to focus on in school now, and that's all on top of normal things like chores and taking care of myself etc. I feel like I'm at my breaking point.

My situation is me and my husband wants kids and we are about to plan  that by next year 2025 January, so we are waiting cause I want to change my job.I hate the work I do and I'm working on moving to developer roles, so I'm learning a lot and it's very overwhelming, given my situation I have only 6 months time.

The time frame is constantly stressing me, it's making me question my choices cause I cannot loose a chance by taking a worng step. Even when I'm studying have this constant thing running in my head I can't concentrate and it's very overwhelming, I just don't want to delay having kids and I don't want to work in this role I'm currently working.

This is like a night mare and when I say this to my husband he is taking it very personally like , he is thinking I don't want kids, all I want is a good career the career I want for myself and I don't want to regret my postponing the family planning thing.

It's stressing me a lot, I've been seeing my peers how they are very free to choose career as they are not married yet, and they making their way to their dreams and me here fighting between the time I have kept,

I hate being the person who is low(not achieving what I want), my husband says that your life doesn't end if you have kids you can change career even after kids, but don't you think one will have that time after kids, and after kids my experience will be like 5 years and changing a career then is like a huge thing, omg it's soooo stressful I cannot believe I'm in this situation.

Self-reflection and motivation are crucial for enhancing mental health. Self-reflection allows individuals to examine and modify their thoughts and behaviors, leading to reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. Motivation, particularly when intrinsic, enhances self-concept and emotional well-being.

1eo78g0,stress,"Need some advice, stressed","The last year has been really difficult for me. For starters my dad was diagnosed with cancer (early stage pancreatic cancer but still a dangerous type of cancer). I'm an only child and very close to my father. The treatments have been arduous including major surgery and he's finally finished chemo. Most recently we have had a scare as some of his cancer markers are elevated slightly again and were awaiting repeat imaging.

To add to the above, once my dad was diagnosed I decided to get married to my longtime girlfriend to make sure my dad could attend and we got engaged in November and have been planning a wedding for the end of this month in close turn around.

Ive been trying hard to manage my stressors. I feel like I'm in fight or flight mode everyday. I picked up boxing, workout daily. I try to maintain a meditation practice. 

This past month has been really challenging. As my wedding is coming up and with the recent health scare for my dad I feel overwhelmed. The meditation isn't working like it used to. I'm trying more somatic grounding techniques now just focused on box breathing but had a panic attack at my birthday party having to lock myself in the bathroom for 10 minutes. 

Recently I tried a weed edible and I didn't like how dark my thoughts got and ive experienced for the first time a recurrent feeling of things ""not feeling real"". I've later named this as derealization. I think this is a new phenomenon for me.

I have been seeing a therapist regularly for about 2 years as I've always struggled to manage anxiety. I'm not sure if I should try medications. On one hand this I feel is an acute reaction to the external stressors in my life and am not sure if medications are appropriate. On the other hand I feel like I'm staring down the barrel of this stress existing for several years and I don't imagine there being an obvious reprieve and I'm just...exhausted.

1eqdtdi,careeradvice,Job searching and getting more interest that I anticipated,"Here is the situation: I am a project manager at a government contractor. We lost our big contract (way above my level, beyond anything I did or could do). So all of our work is sunsetting, including the project I manage. I am going to need to find a new job or else I will find myself unemployed.

To be honest, I am a bit behind the curve. I could have been doing this months ago, but I wanted to see my project to the end, look after some people.

Starting last week, I applied for project manager positions at a number of companies I am familiar with. I was hedging my bets. I was worried about ANY getting back in touch, based experiences now in the distant past that scarred me. 

But to my surprise, I've been getting call backs from just about every one I've been applying to. I do think I have a strong resume for a project manager position.

I've gotten a callback on one and think I am a strong candidate. Call this Company A. They are my #1 choice for a lot of reasons...the work, company culture, compensation. But I also think this will be the most competitive position I am competing for.

I've also gotten callbacks from two other companies, lets say Companies B & C. They are good companies and I could see myself working for them. Even though they are the second choices, they have good culture, good compensation. 

The thing is, they are driving hard for me. So I guess my concern is that given my fear of unemployment, I am worried about pushing them to the side and then not getting an offer for Company A, and being unemployed. But on the other, Company A is a company I really, really want to work for. Have for a few years.

I've been trying to break into the environmental/wildlife field since graduation but no luck at all, and I'm seeing very similar things from lots of people saying they just can't get a job in the field.

I currently have a full-time job but it's not paying near enough and it's very physically intense, we constantly have people going out on stress leave or injury and I just need something new. I'm debating taking a shorter program at a college to try and get myself something where I can get a job and one that doesn't pay the bare minimum, but I just don't have experience in any or know anyone who's in these fields myself.

1epksoc,college,Is it normal to feel dread about my future a year into my degree,"For context, I’m a second year architecture student from Singapore. I went into architecture purely due to parental pressure and “encouragement”. I have an art background of about 4 years, and they assume that the skills and interests are directly transferable into architecture. 

I have tried my best to understand architecture and why all of my peers are so passionate about it, but I am still struggling to this day to even appreciate most works of architecture. And with architecture being a passion driven occupation, the reality of my situation has really sunk in even within my first few weeks as an architecture student.
The feeling I experience when I walk into studio is incredibly bleak. Everyone around me is in love with this subject that I don’t understand at all. I’m used to working long hours, something transferred from my time in high school, but I’ve seen the sun rise an unhealthy amount of times, and have suffered from a lot of accidents because of it. The payout from my efforts aren’t all that rewarding either, with my results being mediocre at best, I also face additional pressure from my parents as they are unaware of how grading works in creative fields, and expect me to get gpas of higher than 4/5. (This is considered low by my school’s standards, most people in other fields easily get upwards of 4.3 per semester while I’m struggling to maintain my 3.9)

The environment in the school is also more negative than anything else. Our department has an incredibly infamous reputation in the university as being a death trap for young creatives with a turnout rate of 7% who actually move on into the architecture field after graduation. I’ve had professors during crit tell people that “if you don’t pull at least several days of all nighters that you’re not serious about your work at all” and that you can expect your pay to be absolutely abysmal, because “it’s for the passion.” I’ve seen professors work until 4am, have been told constantly that we’ll fail the semester, been told it never gets better. And it’s only been one year into this 5 year programme.

I know a lot of my friends who are trying to get out of the programme, but have failed due to low gpas and whatnot. As a result, a lot of people stuck in this degree are actively seeking a way out, but are unable to due to the school. I experience genuine, stomach turning dread thinking about my life after university. I really can’t see any positive future for myself, with expected low pay, terrible work hours, terrible work balance and no bonus increases.

1dzpre1,university,[Academic survey] Investigating academic stress in university students,"Many students in undergraduate degrees suffer from increased stress levels stemming from concerns about performance, deadlines, workloads, and the various life changes associated with this period of development. We are interested in the ways students can address or counteract feelings of distress emerging from these academic stress sources. We are specifically curious about how feelings of overall satisfaction in life can be maximised for students currently engaging in stress-inducing academic activities. 

Our area of research is concerned with how taking an approach to life focussing on excellence rather than perfection (that is, creating high yet achievable standards, having flexible goals and finding satisfaction in accomplishments) and realistic goal-setting can reduce distress, and if participating in non-academic leisure or hobby activities can help students cope with experienced distress. 

If you decide that you’d like to take part in this research, you’ll complete an online survey comprising 58 questions, including questions about your experiences with academic stressors, feelings of distress, overall life satisfaction, excellencism, and extracurricular activity engagement, as well as questions regarding your assigned sex at birth, gender, sexual orientation, age, undergraduate degree enrolled in, and year of study. The survey should take no more than 30 minutes to complete. 

If you are a first-year student in Psychological Science at the Australian College of Applied Professions, you’ll receive one credit point for taking part. 

This research is being conducted by Mr. Mendy Kinstlinger toward his Bachelor of Psychological Science (Honours) degree in the Discipline of Psychological Sciences at the Australian College of Applied Professions (ACAP). Mendy is supervised by Associate Professor Fiona Ann Papps. 

To complete this survey, we ask that you are: 

* 18 years or older. 
* residing in Australia. 
* attending an undergraduate degree. 
* able to read and understand proficient enough in English, by your own assessment, to complete an online survey in English. 
* not in a personal relationship with any of the researchers.

I went into this line of work as I am a sensitive person and wanted to help people.  However, after spending a number of years doing these roles,  I do not believe our socio-economic and cultural circumstances are conducive of anyone's wellbeing. Many people work so hard just to make ends meet. Many are isolated, many have family issues, many do not have positive communities or meaningful pass times. Our economy does not provide many with the time and energy to prioritise their wellbeing. Our culture is focussed on promoting ourselves and not looking after or being good to each other. Mental illness and distress should not be as widespread as it is. 

Since I've worked in education (Student Wellbeing) I've noticed that so many people have children when they can not or do not prioritise giving their children a good life. Many families engage in services to gain access to funding and do not (or perhaps can not) change the circumstances that are resulting in their children's lack of wellbeing/welfare. 

I'm really over it all. I just want out. I do some self-employed work, however, I'm not sure this will be enough for me to live off. I don't know what other work to pursue.

1ekczom,careeradvice,"Career switch at 26, worth it?","I'm 26, turning 27 next month, unemployed since last October, from India and I'm at a standstill career wise. 

Little background, I'll try to be brief. 
Passed highschool with decent grades, got into probably one of if not THE BEST college in India (St. Stephens, DU). 
Had it not been for the prestige of the college i probably would've opted for B.A in psychology instead of B.A in eng and philosophy which I did and despised most of the semesters of. Ended up being held back a year due to attendance. 

I had always planned on joining the army and did my undergrad as a backup plan, so that's one reason why academics never interested me, except for the time when I was preparing for the Army. I had ambitions to join the infantry, being regarded as very charismatic, athletic with the makings of a soldier (per my family and friends).
I was also influenced to join the forces because my immediate family and closest relatives were in the forces. 

Well, that didn't happen, I couldn't crack the written exam because I gave myself too little time to prepare, I took my time for granted. Anyway, I'm past the age limit to try again. 

I started working as a copywriter for an agency, and copywriting came naturally to me. At present with 2 years of experience as a social media specialist I've dealt with a lot of aspects and verticles inside of social media, from copywriting, client servicing, design concepts, campaigns, pitching etc. and I had to quit last October due to their extremely late salary disbursals due to which often times I and my colleagues were spend out of our own pockets, large amounts which were rarely reimbursed. Every month we had to beg the accts dept to release our payment.  Toxic work culture, late hours, lack of a team which caused the workload to pile up. 

After that I focused on a side hustle, invested savings and it failed. Can't say it was a waste because the hustle was tied to social media which just didn't pan out due to investment required which I just couldn't afford to continue. 

I'm at a point now where I have realised that I don't have the passion, or drive to work in social media. Idk if that's the joblessness insecurity, or an ""aha' moment. I like stability and certainty, which in the world of social media keeps changing, and if you can't keep up with it you're as good as a monkey with a pen.

The career switch I want to make is from a social media specialist to a clinical/counselling psychologist. 

I have always been the type of person that seeks to look deeper than what's on the surface, and that personality of mine has only grown recently when my family and peers pointed it out. My friends who are close to me or know me personally often seek advice from me about different subjects like sadness, helplessness, social anxiety, bad self image, doubt, suspicions, assumptions. I keenly observe people's body language, emotions or language (words that have heavy connotations). 

Anyway, with this switch I'll probably be discarding my professional experience as a SM specialist and I don't want to earn in breadcrumbs if I am unsuccessful with psychology because I'm not great with academics. (Aside from the army exams, Ive never been interested in academics. But maybe if I study a subject that interests me, I could excel?)

When it first started (I can't remember when but less than a year ago), I assumed it was bad trapped gas or something that I was unable to relieve but it's been happening more often of late. I thought it was an eating thing but I haven't really changed my eating routine much for the last couple of years.

Does anyone else suffer similarly?

I know I've been more stressed than usual but I swear I've been worse than this and it's never caused these symptoms. So naturally my health anxiety is having a field day and likely making it all worse.

It's a neverending cycle.",2024-02-02 07:00:05,3,4,1,Negative,-0.0589506172839506,0,0,0
1bzieo5,stress,I (22F) feel like my anxiety is taking over.,"I (22F) have always had problems with anxiety. 

I have always really struggled with anxiety. It’s always been hard for me to express how I’m feeling too. So here’s the story, right now I am working in the kitchen as a pastry chef and though I love my job, it can be quite stressful sometimes. Just this week, I actually had to step away to catch my breath because I felt like the walls were closing in on me. I love my job and i don't want to stop doing what i love because of stress. Lastly, I have an amazing boyfriend, and though he cares about me because of my past relationships I tend to put a lot of pressure on myself. Im worried im not pretty enough , skinny enough, smart enough you name it . He is very understanding and always lets me know no matter how I feel hes on my side and loves me very much.( sidenote about my past relationships I’ve been cheated on twice and one of the cyberbuilled me and spread ugly rumors too which added a lot of stress and doubt).Usually I’ve been able to deal with all this stress with different things but now I just feel like it’s overtaking me. Every day I come home and I’m having to take about 1000 breaths per minute because I just can’t seem to feel like myself, it just feels like the stress is now taking over my life. I have tried many different things to manage my stress over the years. When I was in college, I did therapy for quite a while but unfortunately now that I’m out of college, I can’t afford it. I’ve tried meditation, and that just wasn’t for me. I was told that working out could help manage my stress but instead it makes it feel 10 times worse!I feel out of place whenever I go to the gym and I feel like everyone’s looking at me staring at me and instead of feeling de-stressed I feel even more stressed. It’s also added stress to make time to go to the gym and I feel stressed when I can’t make it to the gym if I’m busy. I just wanna start feeling like myself again. I dont want to feel as if one thing goes wrong the world is gonna end . If anybody has any tips and tricks on what to do, I would love to hear it. Thank you.

okay for context me and my bf haven't ever had sex like it's just been like me going down on him and him using his fingers on me. about 3 weeks ago? i think? he like rubbed his thing over me like just on the outside and i don't recall him having precum but i'm not too sure and he didn't put it inside, it did go near the hole tho. and take in this only happened for 2ish minutes and then we stopped. i also had one of the most stressful months in june as it was final exam season and me and him also had been arguing a lot and just a bunch of things were stressing me out. my period doesn't come on the same time every month but my single has like switched between being 28-40 days. right now i'm on day 34 and still haven't gotten my period. i took a lot of vitamin c yesterday trying to induce it but i'm so so so stressed about being pregnant. i was perfectly fine until i started reading random articles and freaked myself out even more. i can 10000% guarantee that i have never ever had sex. it did not go inside of me. i haven't gained any weight or anything but i just experienced the same symptoms i would get every time the week before my period starts. i know stress plays a big role in delayed period but i just don't know how to stop stressing. i've missed my period for a whole month before due to stress but it's super rare that this happens. i just need to ease my mind somehow.

1ejuxdv,stress,Residual Stress in the Body ,"I believe I’m experiencing the effects of residual stress.

April, May, leading into early June I suffered panic attacks on top of panic attacks. High anxiety and hypervigilance for months on end. My blood pressure also reached highs I never knew it could.

Since I’m unemployed, I’ve dedicated my time to being outdoors, running 1 mile a day, disc golf, and pickleball since May 2. Also eating much healthier and sleeping way more.

I can safely say I’ve overcome this hurdle in my life. I no longer feel the anxious thoughts or extreme energy 1st thing in the morning. I’m changed. Still unemployed, but in a much better headspace.

BUT I believe I have residual stress caused by leftover stress hormones in the body. 

I twitch throughout the day. Muscle spasms. Scare easily. In the case of a random anxious thought, feel the dread overcome my body and feel the thought intensely. I had a panic attack for the first time last night in a few weeks. 

I want to get rid of the last of whatever this is. I read somewhere my body might have more cortisol than dhea. 

What should I do? Anybody else go through something similar?",2024-08-04 13:12:22,2,2,1,Positive,0.13254385964912282,0,0,2
1e63psn,stress,Stressing about losing someone,"I've been dealing with a fair bit over the last 3-4 years.

I've been dealing with generalized anxiety and panic attacks for some time. Feb of 2021 me and my wife of 7 years divorced. After that, because of split custody, I no longer have my children with me every day, and I think that is the root of my panic attacks. Too much free time when they aren't with me makes me feel wrong.

December of 2021, my father passed away. It was a fentynal overdose and was very, very sudden. I didn't have a very good relationship with him and I hold a lot of regret for not putting effort into mending that connection.

September of 2022, my grandmother passed from acute leukemia. I loved her to death.

Since then, my mother has moved into my house and been living with me. I came home from work (I work 3rd so I came home in the morning) yesterday, and she was not feeling well. She said she woke up feeling this way. In pain and feverish. She didn't want to go to the doctor but said she would go tomorrow morning if it didn't improve.

I can't stop thinking about what if something is seriously wrong with her and if i am going to lose her now too. It's to the point that i've been on the verge of tears all night. (Currently at work)

What are some tips/advice to try and calm my mind? I feel like im being extremely obsessive over this situation and freaking out for no reason. But my mind persists, and I feel helpless.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",2024-07-18 05:27:33,1,1,1,Positive,0.17233333333333334,0,0,2
1er8tag,careeradvice,What are top career paths to consider looking for people in their late 20s ? ,"


I'm currently in community college and I just have no clue what I'm doing. I even stopped taking classes for about a year now. I'm feeling overwhelmed because of the success my peers and cousins have. Im not jealous but I wish I knew my path that I could focus on my energy. Right now I'm only working at some retail store and it really sucks feeling. Don't like to work there. It's not fulfilling. It feels like I'm forcing myself to go because I have no other option at the moment.

Classes will start soon, but I have not found clarity. Sometimes I feel like I'm not smart enough in math and science. I guess it's doubts sighs.  Everybody is doing computer science, data science, engineering, nursing, law, AI machine learning and so on. Atleast they will make $100k up and some able to work remotely.

1bkakzn,stress,Instant help: A directly applicable and tried-and-tested step-by-step guide against inner restlessness and stress,"Hey guys, 

do you know a book which describes the following, or are you interested if I find one?:

War, pandemic, inflation. The decade burdens many people with a lot of additional baggage. There are self-help books available on the market for people who feel constant inner restlessness and are constantly stressed. Most of these books are scientific and very complicated.

  
To those who are worried:

If it existed: What would you think of a proper practical step-by-step guide that offers real life tested and therefore working psychological strategies to return to inner peace and a calm mind?

  
In times of information overload, the guide should be short, clear and full of valuable content. This can include advice on general techniques for reducing stress and going deeper by addressing specific situational triggers. 

For the **trigger**, it provides a **technique for dealing with the trigger** and a practical **example** of how it works, including an **explanation** of why it works.  


For example:  
**Constant trigger:** General restlessness – I feel worried and therefore nervous. The feeling is there constantly and I don't like it but don't know what to do about it.

  
**Technique: Clarity-creating introspection flow**  
Step 1: Clear your head - Quick clearing is 3-4 rounds of Wim Hof breathing (would be explained in the book, but for those who don't know now -> I recommend googling it)  
Step 2: Take a piece of paper and a pen  
Step 3: Let your thoughts guide you. Write everything down. If a thought interrupts you, allow it. Use a “-”, put a number above it and just let it flow. The most disturbing thoughts will return. So you can simply take the number from when the thought first appeared. Then write the number on the new hyphen and thus tie in with the first section of thought.  
Step 4: Reread your flow (can be painful but very liberating). Search for a topic or topic  
Step 5: Write down the topic  
Step 6: What could solve the issue?  
Step 7: Take one small step now to solve the problem.

  
**Example:** I feel very stressed. I clear my head with my breathing exercise (step 1). I take my piece of paper and let my thoughts flow (steps 2+3). I see that I keep having the critical thought that complains about the lack of progress on my project. I call my topic “Project too slow” (steps 4+5). I brainstorm and come to the conclusion: I need to break my project down into many, many more subgoals (Step 6). This way I can get more done and procrastinate less.  
My action step now is: I take the “breakdown of the project plan” approach and spend just one mandatory minute opening my project plan and formulating another doable task.  
Then I'm done, or I can keep working on it, it doesn't matter. I'm clear about what's bothering me subconsciously and I know what I can do about it, and I've already taken one step towards it.

  
**Functionality:** Bringing subconscious thoughts to light and putting them on paper, resolving them and acting on them will solve the underlying problem. Step 6 and Step 7 can be repeated until the entire cause is resolved.  
I would really appreciate an e-book guide like this. What about you guys? Do you know a book like that? Is this a type of help you would like to use (if not, what kind of support would you prefer)?

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading this far and for your taking your time.

1ery4fb,careeradvice,Corporate Burnout Advice,"I 25F have been working in compliance for a relatively short period of time (5 years) 

During these 5 years i had 3 jobs; 1 for 3 years, 1 for 6 months (i was let go due to manager being an ahole who was ultimately fired) and my current 1 year and 2 months. 

Ive always had a problem with people not accepting that i have coloured hair and a bunch of tattoos and piercings. Whilst i keep back from getting what i want done for the sake of keeping a job. 

I have been working almost 9/10 hours a day just to stay afloat, if i take leave i have to make up for it, people are always giving us shit cause we are compliance after all. I am only paid for 8 hours and thats €1.8k a month, which is barely enough at the moment to get by with paying the rent and groceries only.

I got into this job industry after graduating in Criminology and its all that was available at the time. 

I wake up tired all the time, i dont have the energy to go out, i am missing the best years of my life cause of my work. 

Im just looking for advice, if there is any, on any jobs that would allow me to be “gothic” but at the same time get the same salary (given that i have rent and groceries to pay). 

Unfortunately i am not artistic at all so tattoo industry isn’t too viable at the moment. I was thinking piercer but where i live we have enough piercers.

1902vyn,stress,extreme dress making me sick,"This is going to be long but I really need to vent and heal myself. Just constantly been hit with a series of traumatic events back to back and have been falling chronically SICK and I’m sick of it. 

To make it easier - I’m going to list down down whatever has happened in my life since 2018 and maybe I can have some help from all of you telling me and validating that it’s been a lot and whatever I’m feeling now ( the health issues // chronic sickness // anxiety // depression ) is a result of all these years of stress. 

A bit about my background : So I come from a well to do family where I grew up with a comfortable life. I’m also a type A go getter personality so I’ve gone to a top college and topped high school. I’ve been hardworking all my life but we come from a background where all needs were more than taken care of for generations to come. 

1) When I was in 11th grade - my dad got arrested for financial fraud - that was a BIG thing in high school but now when I look back - I don’t even know how I would have coped with that. I don’t remember that phase of my life at all. I thought I coped with it well but Ofcourse the state I am in now - 15 years later - I can see signs of how that would have impacted me and made me anxious. 

Post this, my dad got out in one month and never made it seem like we had issues again. He didn’t prepare us to tell us that we were going bankerupt. 

2) Cut to 2018, WE GO BANKERUPT. And when I mean bankerupt - it’s literally 0 money in our family of 4 in all our accounts . You can imagine the shock 

3) At the same time my best friend passed away in front of me - fully catching fire in a freak incident where it was just two of us. 

4) Suddenly my parents have no choice but to ask me for money to run the house even though they didn’t want to but they had no choice. 

5) I don’t have a problem to help out but I wasn’t prepeared and the hardworking person I am , I took up 2-3 jobs to help out. 

6) With no money in the account and with barely any help in the house - my dad takes a loan to get my older brother married and has a BIG fat wedding for him. 

7) I was dating a guy for 3 years who I end the relationship with because it was going no where and I have multiple guys meeting me over the next 3 years till ( today ) where side by side I’ve been working hard to get myself some stability financially. 

8) I’ve met about 3-4 men who have dated me for three months each - and dumped me . I feel that they’ve dumped me because of what my family has gone through and it’s really affected my self worth and self esteem .

I now feel alone and sick. 


- I’ve had a super stressful 3 years of my life and started getting constipated last year during the summer of 2022 on a two month trip to london.

I’ve never had digestion issues before this but started getting constipated and really really hard and painful poops which started bleeding. 

I have severe health anxiety so you can imagine the anxiety I got on top of all the stress I’ve been going through .

I went to my doctor and he told me it’s a fissure and it’s nothing to worry about. 

This was in 2022. I never went back to him in 2023 because he told me to stop stressing out but I get constipated every 2 - 3 months with a bit of blood. 

It’s causing me a pix of anxiety the whole day and I’m unable to get out for a single night with my friends to drink without feeling like it’ll hurt me the next day. 

I’m taking a Sena stool softener whenever I’m constipated and it helps me to go properly the next day without too much pain and no blood. 

The cycle continues where I’m fine for a month or two and the constipation and following anxiety comes back. 

I’m so scared I have stomach cancer or something but going back to the doctor again and again for reassurance is also something I can’t do. 

I just need a break now and I want to feel better. 
Not constantly sick and unwell and thinking I’m dying of cancer. I really need some mental peace and reassurance as I’ve thought I’ve had some kind of cancer all day everyday for more than a year or two and this is while I’m working really hard and trying to remove some chaos for my life. My stomach just dosent help and I keep thinking I have a severe disease. 
My blood tests were all completely normal so I don’t undersnd why my stomach just can’t behave. 

Before this stomach issue cropped up- I was extremely regular with my work outs even though stressors existed. The one thing that helped me cope. Ever since I’ve started getting constipated - I’m fatigued - can’t do anything and it’s a vicious cycle. 

I just want to be better :(

1epmq7y,careeradvice,"5-6 years of studying to be a nurse, I (M24) ended up withdrawing. Looking for other options.","As embarrassing as this may sound, I've been in school for a while trying to finish a bachelor's in nursing. Doing the classes were stressful enough (I suck at studying), but once I actually got into the hospital I was really starting to doubt whether or not nursing is for me. I ended up withdrawing as I need to take care of my mental health. But I'm still willing to find other options if it's not nursing. The question is, what though. 

I read somewhere during the pandemic that there a huge burnout for nurses, which is something I expected, and they ended up switching to tech or accounting. I was thinking of getting into tech but I have no experience whatsoever in that field. I also heard they have a good work life balance and work from home. I'm especially curious what cybersecurity analyst is like. But if anyone who has experience in the tech field that wants to give me an honest talk about the field, that will be great. 

But if there are other people in other fields that have other suggestions in other fields not related to nursing, I'm all ears. Thanks.",2024-08-11 14:57:06,1,11,1,Positive,0.1142857142857143,0,0,2

1d2h9ai,academia,Life after a postdoc and navigating industry?,"Hi all-

I am looking for some thoughts regarding how to navigate my next career move. I received my PhD in applied mathematics in 2021 and then started a T32 postdoc for two years and a third year extension under a different grant (but similar project initiatives).

After a really really tough postdoc experience (super toxic work environment, some title 9 issues that never get addressed because HR hasn’t been productive in academia among other issues) and not a lot of positive movement with respect to a lead in academia, frankly I am burned out. The amount of stress and mental health issues I have has started to impact my physical health as well. 

So with my academic experience and learning more about the financial workings and expectations within academia, I would like to make a career switch to industry. This is definitely a sad but necessary transition for me, as I’ve loved teaching and working with students, and the research, but I can’t continue with the constant ‘we love what we do and that’s why it’s okay to not make money, but also publish or perish’.

As classic advice from my parents, ‘ find something that you love to do’. But this postdoc experience has caused me to shift my mentality around careers and working- I want to find a job that supports my ability to have time for myself- it’s not a big ask, but it’s not something that is supported robustly in academia either (seems like research becomes every academics hobby and passion project). I really am not even asking for a luxurious life, but I would love to come home from work and not feel guilty about actively not working. I track my working hours, it’s an ongoing argument with my spouse, and I pull easily over 60 hours a week and find it difficult to allocate anytime for anything other than research.

So I am seeking advice about this transition-

I don’t need a lot, I am fortunate to have a spouse that is able to also work, and we don’t have human dependents (obviously our two cats are the lights of my life). Academia also does a good job of getting you accustomed to lower salaries (hello to 56k/year…) I just want a job that will give me time to get back into hiking, and painting, and not feel sick to my stomach when I am away from my computer.

In fact in many ways, I think I would thrive in a more mundane position where I can really do an excellent job at my tasks because I don’t feel this intense pressure. But when I apply to positions - I am experiencing the classic issue of being incredibly niche in experience (I always thought a PhD would be a excellent way to demonstrate one’s ability to synthesize and use new and complex ideas, but it feels as though having the exact, proper experience with little ‘learning on the job’ and ‘employee potential’ seems to not be as helpful as my first job out of college (with a bachelors)).

How can I communicate to positions that I am willing to take the lower salary? Or that I may be overqualified with education, but I still really want the job because of the ability to support myself and my interests outside of work.

For context also, the job application process has not been good, even jobs I have felt an excellent fit for (not overqualified or even a career change, and staying research focused and a lateral step) and have still been rejected. This is okay, again academia does a good job at making you expect rejections (still just as disappointing).

I am frustrated trying to communicate my ‘passion’ for a job, when my passion is just about existing in a life that is more easy than this. My life has flown by these past three year and I don’t even feel like I lived through it because my life became so embedded to be in front of the computer. This all makes me sound lazy and like I don’t want to work- but the 60+ working hour week is killing me and I don’t know how to pivot, especially because I feel research-adjacent positions will force me into the intense working hours again and I am unable to make headway in other job-areas (again maybe the niche-ness of academia/academic skills).

Anyway- a bit of a ramble, but any advice or personal stories that relate would be really helpful insight. I’m a first generation college grad, so my parents were not overly supportive about grad school and thought I should just join the workforce immediately, (but going to college wasn’t encouraged either and that’s a whole separate issue). Therefore when coming to them about advice I receive a good amount of “I told you so”. I just really really loved math.

1eouip2,careeradvice,How to get a job as a Mechanical/Industrial Engineering Master's student with no industry experience?,"I am about to complete my Master's in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering in Canada, focusing on operations research and mathematical optimization. I did not have experience with operations research before my Master's as my undergraduate was in mechanical engineering and am still not sure it is the right field for me or if I have a strong background or knowledge in operations research. Despite maintaining a high GPA and having strong programming skills, as well as experience with optimization software like Gurobi and machine learning frameworks, I have not secured any internships or job offers. My only work experience has been as a Teaching Assistant.

I have gained project experience in areas such as robotics and machine learning applications in healthcare, but these have all been in academic settings through coursework. While I have accepted the PhD offer and my advisor believes it is an excellent opportunity for me to expand my knowledge of operations research and that I am prepared to pursue a PhD, having received positive progress reports throughout my Master's, I am more interested in transitioning to industry rather than continuing in academia. My knowledge is mostly theoretical and I also want to gain some practical experience and I think this will also help me keep my options open because I could pursue a PhD later once I gain industry experience and have more time to decide if it is the right path for me. Also, I am mostly sure that I do not want to continue in academia or teaching after my PhD and would want to pursue industry jobs. However, most jobs require experience and I have been unsuccessful in being able to find any job in any field related to engineering, applied science, mathematics, or computer science that I applied to during my Master's or undergraduate studies because of my lack of experience and anxiety during interviews.

Given my lack of practical industry experience, I am wondering how I can best position myself for entry-level roles in fields related to my studies, including engineering, mathematics, applied science, operations research, optimization, or computer or data science. What strategies would you recommend for someone in my position to successfully break into the industry?",2024-08-10 14:36:04,1,0,1,Positive,0.2694580727914061,0,0,2

18av26e,stress,Stress manifesting crazy physical symptoms,"For over a year, I had severe pain in my groin area when working out. I always brushed it off and blamed it on my lack of stretching until I started to get into running. One morning, I was on a short run, when about a mile in I felt shooting pain up and down my leg. 

Long story short, after an X-ray and MRI, it was determined I had an osteoblastoma on my pelvis bone.A bone tumor that occurs in 1% of people. Before the diagnosis, many doctors thought it was cancer and I was truly traumatized by the whole situation. My biopsy was sent to the Mayo Clinic and my scans were passed around to various doctors. Luckily, the surgery to remove it went very well and I was feeling great for about over a year…. working out, running, feeling grateful that this nightmare was over. 

Flash forward to a month ago, I began having pain in that area again. My doctor told me it was most likely a muscle strain and to give it some time. I gave it 2 weeks (stressed as hell because I knew the pain I felt meant the tumor was back) and finally got a script for an MRI. During the week waiting for my MRI, I began peeing a lot. I usually pee when I’m nervous but this particular weekend I was peeing every hour with bladder pressure. On Monday, I went to urgent care. My urine was negative for a UTI but I was prescribed antibiotics anyway for preventative measures. The antibiotics made me feel horrible (dizzy, nauseous and weak). I stopped taking them after the first day and felt pain in my back. I ended up going to the ER concerned that the infection had gotten worse. The hospital did a CT scan where they told me my kidneys and urinary tract looked fine— even my bloodwork was perfect! In the CT, they were also able to get a view of my pelvis which they did notify me that they see new growth at the surgical site. I was completely devestated because I knew this meant re-living the nightmare I had been through prior. I met with my surgeon later that week who told me reoccurrence was rare but possible and told me my options. Every since meeting with him, I’ve felt dizzy and extremely anxious. I had a panic attack a few days ago and have moments throughout the day where I feel like nothing is real and I’m going insane. I’m constantly crying and I’m scared these feelings won’t go away. I’m usually never anxious, excercise, eat healthy and have never had any past medical issues so I’m concerned.

1ei1hmk,careeradvice,Leaving Teaching ,"I’m a teacher in Florida. I make 50K a year.

I work 10-11 hour days (paid for only 7). I also work weekends and summers (for free). 

Why do I work so much outside of work hours? Well, I work at a school for troubled youth. Every little altercation (whether verbal, physical, or online) requires 10+ pages of documentation and witness statements.  This is in addition to lesson planning and grading and just grasping the weird things that Florida wants you to teach. Also, IEPs and other student documentation that is needed on short deadlines. For what it’s worth, “traditional” schools are just as bad with paperwork and meetings. 

Some may say to set boundaries or learn to say no.  Well, that’s how you get fired.  What happens when time-sensitive paperwork isn’t in on time? I get a letter in my file. Then I get flagged as not-renewed. Teachers are on yearly contracts that need to be renewed at the end of each year. 

And yes, we are unionized… not that it carries much weight in Florida. 

“Say no” just isn’t possible in this profession.

THE BIG ASK … 

What is the best way for me to transition into corporate America? How can I get into Learning and Development? Or curriculum development? Or are there other areas that I can do well in with experience as a teacher. 

Or, are there other better options? How do I supplement my income?

What are some good options that may allow me to continue being a teacher but allow me to consult or engage in remote work? 

Why corporate America? At least get paid for the insane hours I put in and be able to afford a decent vacation. Retire with something in the bank. Yes, the work hours will be extensive, but hopefully the gross income will match the hours.

Why more income? 50K BEFORE taxes is not enough for a single person who also wants to enjoy life (like a road trip to Bucees and the beach or maybe a cheap cruise or buy all the BOOKS to read!) Also, the Disney area is expensive! 

Other considerations to help you help me: 
- 35 year old
- Single 
- Male
- Teaching for 15+ years (higher ed, k-12, leadership and admin experience)
- Not open to relocating - caregiver to an aging parent

1e50zjk,academia,Alternatives to Academic Careers,"[Short Version]

Hello. I'm currently working as an RA in a university. BA in Sociology. MA in Data Analytics. Working on a paper, will be listed as an author, not sure it will actually be published yet. I am wondering what career paths do you think I could shoot for if I were to give up academia.

[Context]

These days, I am going in and out of burnout. Switching back and forth between wanting to be in academia vs giving up. I think I have plenty of passion and curiosity. People say I do work a lot. 

But when I asked my professor what it takes to stay in academia, my professor basically told me to 'give up having a life' if I want to stay in academia. Apparently competition is worsening, and I'll have no chance if I don't grind harder. As much as I want to be in academia, not sure if I can take that level of stress. Things feel pretty bad as is.

What is even worse is that I don't even see the light at the end of the tunnel. Even if I did give up my life for a PhD, I take one look my professor's insane workload, and realize it gets worse in some ways. And when I ask myself, 'Will that life really make me happy?' The answer is increasingly sounding like a confused 'no...?'

[Question]

I am still not quite sure if I should pivot away from academia. But I think it would be massive help to me if I knew what was at the other side. Would love to be in some sort of research role, but I wonder what they look for in a candidate, and what it is actually like to work.

I would appreciate your stories, advices, and thoughts.

Well I recent started icing my chest and it's a legit game changer.  My stress that would be at 90% or higher has been reduced to 20-45% my resting heart rate that would be high near 100 bpm had been brought down to 70 to 80 BPM. Overall coherence is much better and my energy levels skyrocketed. 

Here are a few links discussing this topic as well. Hopefully this can help some people here as well!

1dzxp2t,stress,Bad stress and also at times feel Stress is starting to condition/addict? Me to more Stress??,"W/out going into life story problems etc...   I got Stress!!!
OK established that. Something unsettling/interesting is occasionally feel like my body/health/nerves are also getting hooked on stress.

A woman who was close to me used to do this in the extreme. She would work hard and get past her stamina limits and then she'd self-generate anger/stress/etc... to spur her on while she continued to work very hard.

With me it's more subtle with notes of stress and fear and obssesive effort, and it comes during legitimate stress and after long stretches of  high intensity/detail effort.

I don't like stress. I have a surplus of stress. So I'm wary of sometimes creating anything extra.

Maybe just stressed?

during my finals i experienced something weird

at somepoint i just could not focus beacause i was feeling my head litterally heating

i was feeling my head heavier and litterally heating from my neck to the back of my head. i felt it throughout the day and it was itensifying when trying to work.

the thing is we are almost a month later and i took the time to sleep and rest a lot but to this day i'm still feeling like that

some days more than other but it never really went away

it's just an overwhelming feeling that is extremely unpleasant

1did5ul,university,Sophomore immigrant student who just moved 4 months ago,"I’m a Colombian student from a really good school in my born city. I just moved to the United States and continued sophomore year here. I really worry about university (actually, I’m aiming to get into Stevens or NJIT), and I’m aware that here is REALLY expensive, specially if it’s a prestigious university. I always think about improving my portfolio and making it more competitive (it’s something that stresses me out), but idk how to. 
I have a lot of achievements in my old school, but now it’s harder for me since I have to start from scratch, and I’m not sure if universities value them since I did them in other country. Some of them are: 27th place in a National Physics Olympiads, 2nd best presentation in a Philosophy forum, president of 10th grade’s student council and 100 hours of volunteering at teaching English to kids from low income families. I have proof of all of them.
In summer, I enrolled to a “dual enrollment program” in WPU (that’ll give me college credits), and I want to do something else but I don’t know where, since my school doesn’t offer a lot of things; Nevertheless, I think I’ll take a Coursera course related to programming, because I’m interested in studying Computer Science (idk if that’ll help).
I want to take the SAT in August so I’ll be able to know in which aspect I should improve.
I’m not good at sports, so I need to find something else that makes me stand out.
My parents always tell me that they cannot afford a university there but I really want to go, and I don’t want to get involved in any long term and high interest debt, I MUST get a scholarship if I want to study.
Any tips?

1cz4fqr,university,"Would I be issued any type of retraining order (no-contact order, Cease and Desist Order, or trespassing order)? I am currently worried about University of Oklahoma staff's impulsive behavior towards me","So I have been blocked accessing OU career center through Handshake. I have been using OU career services for 8 months and I did not have any problems. Lately, I have been noticing change in behavior of OU career services. The career service advisor consistently cancelling my appointment and keep switching me to different career service advisor. One of the last career service counselor lied to me that she is the only career advisor that is eligible for providing me advice in regards to Engineering. Rest of the career service counselor are not qualified to provide me advice regards to Engineering. She even lied she will be gone from the campus until September, and even when she comes back I am no longer allowed to access handshake service.

When I found out about their lies, I got upset and vent my concerns and frustration in the email. My email wasn't hostile, I did not use profanity or anything, I reach out to them professionally and calmly. Today when I called the career service receptionist desk clerk, they told me 'the career service advisor usually responds to email quickly, there is no reason why they should keep my email ignored...they will reach out to me shortly.

Two hours later, the career service receptionist desk clerk called me and pretending themselves as a scam caller...calling me then hangs up immediately when pick up the call. They did this multiple times 'call me and hangs up'. When I call them back, the career center receptionist acts like random caller telling me ""what do I need? Can I help you with anything"". When I try to response with ""who is you"", the clerk ends up hanging up. I traced the called found out that they are calling from 'OU Norman campus', and when I call them the receptionist tells me 'f u, get the f outta here using ethics, and say goodbye', then hangs up. Then receptionist worked with career service and IT to block me from me as soon as they realized I found out about their doing? I then contacted IT and they have been showing sarcasm towards me as well, telling me 'Idk how that happened and how I got blocked from accessing Handshake'. I contacted career service again last time to let them know what their doing is wrong and unprofessional, but their response to that was ""school is dismissed now, don't contact me again"" then hanged my phone number. I am enraged the fact that receptionist is 50, and being acting like 15 year old entitled teenager, cussing, and hurling racial slurs towards me.

If the school told me I am not welcomed to use career services, as well as their technologies (i.e. Microsoft and Excel) after I dropped out of all classes, I would have respectfully obey that. But no they have been saying they will help, but then played mind games with me for eight months. When I found out about their mind games, they are now potentially planning on banning me from the campus? I get it they don't want to provide former student free services, and yes using career service is part of college tuition. And yeah, they make lot of money from student's tuition. Moreover, using Microsoft Excel and Word is part of university tuition as well. They should have told me instantly right after I dropped out the OU Online program.

**Would I be issued any type of restraining order (no-contact order, Cease and Desist Order, or trespassing order), based on situation I have been through career service and IT team? Would they deactivate my OU Outlook email as well within couple days?

1es8qay,careeradvice,Should I quit? ,"TLDR: I am in my late 30s and wondering if I should quit my job.

I was able to move laterally into a role that I’d been aiming for by working hard in several “stepping stone” roles to get to here. It was exhausting but good, hard work that took me several years.

I’m five months into this new role and have maintained a good reputation. In fact, I was recently told my performance and results are “outstanding” and my boss joked that I need a raise.  The issue is that I am just so extremely burned out. While grinding for the past couple of years, I really let my health “go”. I’ve gained weight and my chronic disease worsened. Worst part is I can’t scale back at work right now. I have tried repeatedly to get a better work-life balance, but keep failing myself. When I take vacation (even just a couple of days so far), I find that my work piles up so much that it is overwhelming and worsens my anxiety.  I recently talked about my concern that I’ll burnout with my manager, but frankly not sure he actually cares. If I got paid more or promoted to grind like this, I’d at least be able to rationalize it, but when I brought up the topic of moving up at my company in at least a couple of years, my manager told me he was 10+ years in my role before he moved up.

So I feel like I just need a break. I know that the problem is me. Knowing my personality, I think that I need to just quit and focus on my health, even if I don’t have a backup plan in place. I’m fortunate that my spouse could support me with no problem.

But then I’ll see my work friend, who quit a year ago to take care of 2 kids, unable to find a job. There are so many people vying to get into my company and I start to feel like an ungrateful person for not seizing the opportunities given to me.

1eheny7,stress,No appetite and weight loss ,"TW: talk about weight loss and eating disorders

I’m a university student and come from a really big family with always something happening (pregnancies, divorces, death, drugs, mental health issues, everything you can imagine has happened in our family). Because of this, I deal with quite a lot of stress but any time I feel stressed, I lose my appetite almost completely. The thought of food makes me nauseous and I have no hunger at all. Obviously this usually leads to weight loss, but when I’m less stressed I gain it all back and so it keeps quite balanced. Now I’ve been dealing with a lot of stress for a couple of months (exams, a very stressful pregnancy of my sister in law with a possible miscarriage, my dog died and I had been working 30 hours a week next to ny study) and haven’t had an proper appetite for some time. I’m busy but genuinly don’t feel any hunger and it makes me nauseous just thinking about it. I’m planning on going to my gp to see if she has any tips on what to do. 
But I’ve struggled with anorexia in the past. Not anymore and I’ve literally fought for my life to get myself out of there. But now with all of this going on, everyone around is me doubting me and saying that my eating disorder is back. I know it is not. I know what that’s like but this is not a relapse, it just makes me really sad that no one around me seems to believe that and trust what I say. I get that they’re worried but there’s nothing I can do to prove it to them that I haven’t relapsed because I can’t force myself to eat when I’m nauseous. 

Does anyone have any advice to deal with them?? Or have any tips on how to get enough food even when it physically put you off? ",2024-08-01 11:49:08,3,4,1,Negative,-0.05098039215686274,0,0,0

1ehb23e,university,Should I ask the Journal to retract my article?,"Hi everyone :)

I'm a first-year (provisional) PhD student in social science and recently published a sole-author article on social media usage during the COVID-19 pandemic in a relatively small niche journal. It was officially published and SCOPUS indexed around May.

Two month has passed since the publication and I recently noticed that ResearchGate has listed my article and included it in their database. While browsing the ""Recommended Publications"" section at the bottom of my article’s ResearchGate page, I came across an article from 2021 that seemed similar to mine. I decided to read it, as the full text was available on ResearchGate.

Although the two articles are largely different, there is a section in my article that overlaps significantly with the 2021 article. The wording, concepts, and ideas are similar enough that it could be perceived as self-plagiarism if someone compared them. The only difference would be the references used to support those claims/assertions but surprisingly, there is a few same references in that section as well; I used 11 references for that section of which 7 of those references are also used by the 2021 article. Nothing else in the article is similar to mine.

I wasn’t aware of this other article when I wrote mine, and I’m now worried that people might think I plagiarised when I didn't due to the 2021 article being published earlier than mine. If I do nothing and someone else notices this similarity and reports it the Journal then the subsequent investigation would likely to lead to accusations of plagiarism and as a provisional PhD student, I could be removed from my program if my university gets notified and an academic misconduct case is bought against me.

So, I'm thinking about notifying the Journal and asking them to formally retract my article due to the overlap? But I'm not sure how a retraction will look on my publication record in the long-run? Will it ruin my chances of ever becoming an academic? I definitely don't want to be doing nothing for reasons I stated earlier.

1c80qzt,stress,How i saved myself from the hell of stress and anxiety,"

Severe stress plagued me since my teenage years. A combination of factors fueled the fire: loneliness, a lack of friends, an abusive environment, and indirect bullying from classmates. These experiences turned me into a withdrawn person with social phobia and stuttering. Intrusive thoughts about death and illness, fueled by the loss of two relatives in a short period, further intensified my anxiety.



One day, the pressure reached a breaking point. I started experiencing convulsions and muscle contractions during sleep. My pent-up emotions, tension, and anger surfaced at night. My immunity weakened, and I lost weight. Desperate for relief, I felt doomed yet knew I had to find a way out.



For ten years, I endured torment and stress, yearning for a human connection, a hug, anything to feel safe. With the realization that no one would come to my rescue, I knew I had to take action. No savior would magically appear; I had to be my own Savior.



Despite battling depression and crippling anxiety over everyday things, I scoured the internet for solutions. I craved a quick fix, a savior, a listening ear, but alas, I didn't find it readily. However, I did find an answer.





Books on mindfulness, relaxation, and meditation became my companions. Though skeptical, I decided to give relaxation techniques a chance. I focused on deep breathing and physical relaxation. Initially, I could only achieve a brief sense of calm. Gradually, with practice, I learned to carry this feeling with me – outdoors, in the garden, anywhere. This proved invaluable in managing my social phobia. When faced with physical symptoms like tension, heart palpitations, and shaky legs, I would tell myself, ""Let it shake. It doesn't bother me. I choose to focus on the beauty around me."" By surrendering to my body's sensations, I gradually convinced it there was no imminent danger.





Armed with newfound relaxation skills, I gathered my courage and started going to the gym. Even within the confines of my difficult environment, I felt a shift – a slow but steady improvement in my life. My thought patterns became more positive. Remarkably, I achieved this transformation without a savior, a loyal friend, or professional help.





Today, after ten years of mental anguish, stress, and anxiety, I can finally experience relaxation and positivity. While I still battle some stuttering and social awkwardness, I actively work on improving them. I use relaxation techniques to calm my tongue and speak slowly. Slowly but surely, I'm opening up to people and building social skills, despite internal resistance.



This is a message to everyone: you have the strength to overcome challenges, just like I did. My journey was especially difficult – I fought in complete isolation, with no emotional or financial support. Remember, even the most challenging situations can be navigated. You are capable of achieving the same or even greater progress than I have.",2024-04-19 16:11:08,16,12,1,Positive,0.04296740994854203,0,0,2

My position ends in December 2025, but there is a chance for renewal. Naturally I am thinking about what type of permanent position I would like to have and where my wife and I would like to raise our kids (currently we have a 6yo, 4yo, and 2yo, and are planning on having more). We have decided to consider looking for my employment out of the U.S. (not for any political or social reasons) and so I am interested to know what academic positions and culture in different countries in Europe or anywhere else are like. 

Mostly I am mostly interested in the UK, Scandinavian countries, and western Europe but any information on any country's system is appreciated (Canada, Australia, NZ, South Africa, Japan, Mexico, etc.).  I do speak Spanish and English, but from what I have heard in many European universities outside of the UK not knowing the language isn't too much of a barrier. 

Again, any information is great. But some specific questions are:

How does the secondary school system lead into the university and college academic system for students?

What are courses like? (How much homework, how many exams, main form of assessment, typical failing rates, etc.)

What is the break down of your job in percentages of research, teaching, and service to the department/university?

How much pressure is there to bring in research grants?

What are the main sources of grants? Specifically for STEM  and STEM education fields.

What is the country's cost of living?

Would a family of 5+ be able to live on only the salary of an academic? (My wife works part time as an accountant with a CPA license, but we have always intended for her to stop working at some point and our only income would be mine)

I wasn’t aware of this other article when I wrote mine, and I’m now worried that people might think I plagiarised when I didn't due to the 2021 article being published earlier than mine. If I do nothing and someone else notices this similarity and reports it the Journal then the subsequent investigation would likely to lead to accusations of plagiarism and as a provisional PhD student, I could be removed from my program if my university gets notified and an academic misconduct case is bought against me.

So, I'm thinking about notifying the Journal and asking them to formally retract my article due to the overlap? But I'm not sure how a retraction will look on my publication record in the long-run? Will it ruin my chances of ever becoming an academic? I definitely don't want to be doing nothing for reasons I stated earlier.

Any advice is much appreciated! Thanks.",2024-08-01 07:51:10,1,0,1,Positive,0.07474747474747476,0,0,2

1c796cw,stress,Stress or something more serious ,"I am worried about myself and have been since last May . It all started when I was at a job that I thought I loved but ended up too stressful for me . I thought I could handle it but I couldn't . I made the mistake of being overly independent instead of asking for help at work or home I did things myself which caused problems in my relationships. I had a coworker at first that I thought we got along but things escalated when my good supervisor left but now I'm starting to see why . My coworker decided to get belligerent with me when no management was around. She would fight me, think company policies were stupid didn't want to follow my direction.  She would leave the room when we worked in a medical setting , didn't communicate she was leaving which caused a safety issue to those In our care. She even told me she didn't like to be told things by someone in authority and she was older . Come to find out management failed to let me know her true job description, which could have prevented my poor job performance which was odd because i got previously promoted not to mention or prevent undue stress. I would go home upset to the point of tears. The tension got worse, I got coached and eventually terminated.. new Manager was blind to what was going on and get upset at me . I felt I was wronged and I took the job loss hard . Around the same time , my mom was back in my life which Ive had a traumatic life because of her and other things , she needed my help which caused me more stress, moved in with my husband and I ended up lying to us then she was out of the picture again. I've been trying to take care of myself, wanting to get pregnant, having fights with my husband because I can nag or I get hit with things that affect my mood etc I don't want him to think I'm constantly unhappy or have issues. I went through a period where I nagged him we almost got divorced and the last thing I want to do is lose him because without him I'm literally a nobody. We got a dog that ended up needing a new home due to being hyper that caused me to be stressed. We had a pest problem but got better thought that was because of me. Felt I was going through menopause that caused me to be depressed.  Was worried about losing my husband. Had a family emergency, my job at first thought was being inconsiderate but later it appeared they weren't .I was going through crying spells, felt my heart was going to stop. Had periods then skipped a month now I'm back on track it seems..want to open up but don't know how . Feel people think the worse of me and that I'll take my husband down. Wanting to get close to my in laws but so afraid they will leave me or hate me. Concerned about my husband he's all I have. A best friend betraying me, feeling I dint matter and if I speak up I'm selfish,or afraid I'll be dishonest.  Don't want to lose my husband, miss my sex drive my love for life . We haven't had a vacation or a night overnight somewhere in a while just to get away . Lately I've been hsving gas, neck pain, other strange sensations and worried I'm dying or have cancer or will have a heart attack. I want to tell people how I feel but dint want to be a burden or lose more people.. I am worried about my weight too I don't eat alot of food but still feel really bad about myself and weight . I want to know what's going on stress anxiety or hormones.. like today i feel really bad about myself . I hope it's safe here . 
Am I just under severe stress which doesn't help what I've already been through. I'm. Just scared something is wrong has anyone felt like this ? 

Tldr; really struggling 41 yo f wondering what's wrong. Been hsving life events such as wanting to get pregnant, job loss , family issues concerned about health. Afraid I'm dying. Trying to figure out of stress, or something else . Worried about myself, hope someone can help ",2024-04-18 17:29:43,3,0,1,Negative,-0.05934786461102251,0,0,0

1dvyi0x,academia,Advice on whether it’s time to go…,"Hi all,

I’m posting looking for a bit of advice (U.K. context). 

I’m a Senior Lecturer working at a University in the South of England. I’ve been in my role for 11 years now. It’s a full-time, permanent position. When I was recruited to the position, I didn’t have my PhD. My institution was very relaxed about this, but I had always wanted to pursue my PhD anyway, so after some years, I eventually found somewhere that I thought would offer me the right support and enrolled for my PhD, where I received a tuition fee scholarship. I took the PhD on part-time with assurances from my workplace institution that they would build time into my workload for me to be able to study and complete in a timely manner. 

Fast forward to 2024. My workplace institution, like many, is making hundreds of staff redundant after many rounds of cuts, previously. My Department now consists of three people, including me. Although I am on a teaching and research contract, research is no longer included in the workload, at all. I am expected to contribute to the REF by publication, but publications are not included within the workload and have to be carried out in our ‘spare time.’ Due to years of chronic cuts and understaffing, I now teach an average of 18 hours a week (above the Union legal limit, but we do not have an effective Union branch). I am the Module Leader for six modules, and supervise 15 Dissertations a year on average. Many of the modules that I lead are brand new every year, because we keep getting new managerial staff in who want to ‘change things up’ and instruct us to deliver new modules on specific topics. 

My manager has become despondent and hard to work under. They don’t reply to emails, and if they do, they don’t give any straight answers. They are rude and dismissive and refuse to meet to discuss any planning of teaching or any issues that need to be addressed. I was promised an Early Career pathway but nothing has ever appeared. I was also told I’d receive some sort of mentor, but that’s never happened either. My colleagues are all overworked and stressed and the atmosphere is painful. I can often go weeks at a time without seeing or speaking to a single colleague. My record number of weeks for this was 9 weeks, in the first term of last year. The mood is very low. It seems it’s only a matter of time before our Department closes completely. 

My PhD institution has also been through a lot. I now have a supportive and kind supervisor, but my supervisory team has changed 6 times. The original staff member that I wanted to work with was made redundant in my first year after they whistle-blew on another staff member who was assaulting students. The accused staff member remained in post for another year before they retired. I am a disabled, female student with no family and have found that there is no support from the University. Their Doctoral College is poorly run and either never replies to email or consistently gets basic things wrong, such as my end date, my tuition fee payments, and much more. When they were late technically paying themselves for my tuition fees, they called me and pursued me for the money, advising me to call the bank and get out a loan to pay the fees or be subject to late fees and student sanctions. 

I love some of what I do, especially working with students and teaching, which is really the highlight of everything. I don’t love research, at all. I often work late into the evening or at weekends, and also staff around four or five Open Days each term. I can’t take much annual leave, as the workload piles up so high that it’s impossible to cope with when I return, so I often just don’t take the leave and it expires each summer. 

I have a job interview in industry in a few weeks’ time. 

I would love some empathetic, kind advice from anyone who might be able to help. Is it time to go? I feel so torn, as this is all I ever wanted to do, but I’m worried that academia is making me ill. Part of me wants to close this chapter fully and never look back. The other thinks about how hard I worked to get here, and how much good luck and timing was involved when so many people would love to have a permanent role in the industry. I worry I’m just being a baby and crying over nothing, that this is life and all jobs are like this no matter what. 

Thanks for letting me vent and for reading. Any advice would be massively appreciated. ",2024-07-05 13:51:28,5,6,1,Positive,0.0818499080827848,0,0,2

1ekohys,university,"Long-term student, terrible resume","Hey,

After finishing my vocational school and at the beginning of my first degree, I struggled with numerous issues (drug addiction, anxiety disorder, depression, eventually rehab, then depression again, disorientation). I initially studied electrical engineering (wasn't for me), then mathematics (was totally for me, but was ruined midway due to drug addiction and mental illnesses), then nothing for a while, and now I'm studying physics. I'm in my 22nd semester, and in between, I tutored to earn money (which surprisingly secured quite a good income after some time, but is nothing I can put on my resume), or sometimes I did side jobs for half a year to a year. Now, as I said, I'm in the middle of my physics studies, which actually weren't going so badly, and I was able to get some credits recognized. But now I feel like my mental illnesses are catching up with me again... I'm contemplating quitting everything at 30 years old and looking for some job or even an apprenticeship... But my resume is an absolute disaster, and I feel an incredible amount of shame when I look at this resume that I would have to send out. I can present myself confidently, but inside, I would feel so incredibly degraded and miserable in a potential interview... I'm desperate... Should I continue my studies?

1eivgfc,careeradvice,"Everyone’s quitting at my job, now I want to quit.","Hey guys, using text to speech on this one so I apologize if there’s any typos, I recently picked up a second job to help pay bills and get out of some debt that I’ve been struggling with. When I first got hired everything seemed OK but one by one within less than a couple of months time everyone started quitting, and I feel like the majority of the responsibility is slowly falling on me

For context, I got hired as a manager which I have plenty of experiencing, so I was comfortable entering the role at this new organization within a couple of weeks my colleague who trained me was headed out the door, and all of this was communicated, and I was prepared to say the least. But shortly after things started escalating quickly. 

it started out with one of our employees having a feud with another employee, which then led to one of those employees being transferred out. that’s two men down. then recently someone decided to quit on the spot. I’m not exactly sure what the issue was but my supervisor seem to have a plan so I wasn’t too worried, plus we had assistance from other organizations were sort of like a chain finally just today just as we thought help was on the way with a new hire. The new hire did a no call. No show on their first day of training which apparently they were scheduled a week before that did the same thing and the icing on the cake is that same day? My district manager called to tell me that my supervisor is no longer with the company I was delegated to scheduling and to make sure that there were employees to cover for the oncoming dates of this week while I was being stretched to perform not only my normal duties, but the duties of two other employees, admittedly were small organization, but the amount of workload our organization receives has made things bleak. It’s making me worry about my future with this company

Our current staff are a ragtag team of people who are inflexible and picky when appointed duties and often come up with excuses of… I pulled my leg muscle so I can’t work, or, my stomache hurts so I’m gonna take my sweet ass time, and my fellow colleagues, which I am very sad to say, just aren’t fully competent for the position. For example, we had a register go out for the whole day, which could’ve helped with a busy crowds, but when I took a look at it the next day, it turned out that the power button was just off. I really don’t want to sound like a person who is just focusing on the negative, but it’s hard to see anything positive when everything negative is happening around me I suppose I just need to vent

If you were in a similar situation, would you stay with a company or would you leave?

1emsuko,college,am i a bad person for feeling this way?,"I’m about to move on campus in two weeks. I feel like life is much more stressful with my mother even during ages 13-15.

1enblr8,university,Navigating Pre-College Summers: A Guide for Parents and Students,"Pre-college summers can be stressful for both parents and high school students, particularly since there's no one definitive way to gain admission to your target universities. We've all heard that the college admissions process is holistic, but often we're left wondering **how to stand out** among thousands of other applicants.

It's **never too early to start thinking about university admissions**, as your profile is built over years, not just months. The stories you can tell are typically developed through sustained effort and experiences over time.

If you're a parent looking to guide your child towards a meaningful summer or a student aiming for a productive break, this is for you.



# Why This Summer?

Summer holidays offer students a unique opportunity: there are no obligatory deadlines or school assignments to complete. This makes summer the **perfect time to develop your unique strengths** and showcase what makes you special.

Here's a snapshot of **my pre-college summer** in 2021 and the lessons I learned from it:

# 2021 Summer

* I got into [Yale Young Global Scholars](https://www.linkedin.com/school/yaleygs/) (a competitive 2-week program at [Yale University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/yale-university/) for talented high schoolers worldwide)
* Was selected to [TechGirls](https://www.linkedin.com/company/techgirlsglobal/) and took a class at [Virginia Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/school/virginia-tech/) on ""How to Tell a Story with Data""
* Applied for a license to become a [TEDxUWCSEAEast](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tedxuwcseaeast/) Organizer
* Launched [Writerama](https://www.linkedin.com/company/writerama/) a social enterprise that helps students tell their stories through writing
* Took an online class on [Coursera](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coursera/) from [Yale University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/yale-university/) on the Science of Well-Being
* Applied and got into [Lumiere Education](https://www.lumiere-education.com/) and got mentorship from Harvard alum [Stephen Turban](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenturban/) 
* Spent time with a host family and friends in Singapore
* Learned to cycle



# Key Takeaways from My Summer

# 1. Sit down with your thoughts in the early days of summer and reflect on your values

There is no secret formula to get into your dream university. My summer activities reflect my values and what's meaningful to me. 



***Admissions officers want to read stories—your stories. They want to know about your experiences, your reactions, your learning, and your new perspectives on the world from those experiences.***



Here are the values I identified after my reflection:

a. Learning and challenging myself academically

b. Doing what gives me energy and having fun

c. Spending time with like-minded people and having new experiences



# 2. Next, for each value category you have, come up with a list of activities that align with them

Here's how my summer activities fit into my value categories:

**a. Learning and Challenging Myself Academically:**

* [Yale Young Global Scholars](https://www.linkedin.com/school/yaleygs/) 
* [TechGirls](https://www.linkedin.com/company/techgirlsglobal/) & [Virginia Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/school/virginia-tech/) 



**b. Doing What Gives Me Energy and Having Fun:**

* Applying to become a [TEDxUWCSEAEast](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tedxuwcseaeast/) Organizer
* Launching [Writerama](https://www.linkedin.com/company/writerama/) 
* Online class on [Coursera](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coursera/) on the Science of Well-Being

**c. Spending Time with Like-Minded People and Having New Experiences:**

* Spent time with a host family and friends in Singapore
* Learned to cycle



# You might ask, ""Zebo, what should I do if I don’t know which activities to pick?""

It's okay if you don't know which activities to pick at first. I didn't either. I used my internal compass to choose activities: **I leaned into my strengths**. 

Instead of trying to be a well-rounded student, I **focused on what energized me** and what I was passionate about.

**Ask yourself these questions:**

* What gives me energy?
* What helps me lose track of time?
* What motivates me to jump out of bed in the morning?
* What can I talk about for hours?
* When do my eyes shine?
* What do I do in my free time?
* What kind of movies / activities do I like, and what do they hint about my interests?

# The Challenge that I Faced

Before doing the activities on my list, seeing the common thread among my different activities. I spent a lot of time thinking about my unique ""spike."" Looking back, I learned that **it's hard to identify a common thread without experiencing the activities first.**

I suggest answering the questions above and jumping headfirst into your chosen activities. Afterward, reflect on your experiences. You'll be able to connect the dots and see the patterns.

# Connect the Dots & Summer Experiences 



1. I **love storytelling**, which is why I applied to be a TEDx Organizer and founded Writerama, where we helped students develop their writing and storytelling skills.
2. I enjoy **challenging myself** in areas where I believe learning a new skill can enhance the meaning of what I love doing, such as storytelling. The course I took at Virginia Tech University on storytelling with data showed me that to deepen my passion for storytelling, I’m willing to step out of my comfort zone and learn about data.
3. **Having fun and building relationships** are important to me. That’s why I spent time with friends and host families while exploring Singapore. I realized the crucial role that having fun plays while pursuing other academic and professional goals. I noticed that I tend to learn more about myself, my thoughts, and my actions when interacting with others. Engaging in group activities helped me be fully present. Later on, **I could ask friends and family more questions about my strengths and what sets me apart**. This reflection also helped me decide which stories to share with the admissions officer.



# Remember, stories and learning can come from various sources, also from ordinary activities in life

Amazing stories don't only come from academic settings, summer camps, and classes. They can also stem from **ordinary activities in your life**, such as cooking with your mom, helping your sibling, or, in my case, cycling.

For example, when I was writing my CommonApp personal statement for [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://www.linkedin.com/school/new-york-university-abu-dhabi/), I shared the example of trying to learn cycling, falling many times, and reflecting on what it meant to me about having a sense of fun while pursuing challenges and my perspective on failure.

# Call to Action

My call to action for you is **to get out there and experience**, as you never know which stories would be a good addition to build your narrative.

It is important to **lean into your strengths**, experience activities where you find passion, and, most importantly, **reflect on them deeply so that you develop unique insights** about yourself and/or the way you see the world. After all, two people can experience the same thing but have very **different insights**. It is those insights and perspectives that you develop through experiences that set you apart.",2024-08-08 17:14:50,2,1,1,Positive,0.18005453924808767,1,0,2

I currently have some issues where when I stress, I could swear to you I can feel it in my body. I also wonder does stress have a big role in cancer or dementia too, because essentially your mind is working 2x as hard, to figure things out that we commonly go through (ie bills, relationships, work, etc) feel free to way in.

I don’t have classes on mondays so i’ll be working the weekend + monday but i feel like i wont be able to make that much money from doing that and i’ll probably won’t be hired if i’m only going to be working 3 days.

Hi Guys, firstly thanks for taking the time to read this, very stressed in work and I constantly tense a lot of my muscles, head and hand muscles mostly but if not those then I'm always tense. Forehead muscles are very sore and my hands start hurting once I'm driving more than 20 minutes because I either grip the steering wheel too tight because I'm worrying or I was balling a fist earlier/the night before. If anyone has any general advice to reduce stress and maybe tips on how to make sure I don't tense up all the time that would be great. 

Also, while I'm here I guess, does anyone in the north west UK area have therapy or some sort of class in pure gym they recommend? I'm thinking about getting back in the gym as I'm about 14.5 stone right now (200 pounds) so could do with losing a stone or two, thanks again and I hope everyone is feeling very relaxed!",2024-06-03 22:17:19,1,4,1,Positive,0.16292517006802723,0,0,2
1cfbn4u,stress,Uncontrollable stress before/during driver exam.,"Hello, i did my first drivers exam couple of months ago and although it went good the examiner thought differently but you know what ? it is what is life goes on and after a couple of weeks i take another test and fail again, had some arguments in the car with my dad and was just a mess and should not have taken the exam. fast forward 2 months i took the exam again, but oh boy this time was the worst. Every single day leading up to the exam i had heart palpitations, could not eat well and was just generally down. the day of the exam came again and it was a disaster made a ton of small mistakes which i never made and i felt my heartbeat in my throat. i even had to grab my steering wheel as hard as i could to stop the tremors in my hand. I've talked about this with many people, gotten tips etc but none seem to work. The more re takes i have the worse it gets it seems. I have never EVER had this problem with anything in my life not even once, sure the healthy stress before a presentation but nowhere on this level. I think i'm writing this more as a vent but maybe someone can give some tips ? I don't see it getting better in any way.

  
I also want to add when i drive w my dad alone i can drive perfectly normal without any stress, it's just when driving with the examiner sits behind me it drives me nuts, people told me to just imagine he/she is not there but i just cannot simply turn off their presence.

After the interview, I felt really stressed and didn't feel good. I panicked after interview. I sent the thank you email.

Now it's been about a week and they haven't  answered so I still have time for a follow up email, just to check on them. I thought that I would include in the follow up email that although I haven't had any conflict so far, if I were in a situation like it I would ensure that the conflict doesn't delay or interfere with the progress of completing the project we're working together on then after one of our sessions, I would talk to them privately about the conflict, admit my faults, focus on the actions/events rather than behavior, and work to do better.

 Since this question is pretty important when evaluating if I'd be a good fit for the team and in a team setting, should I clarify my answer via follow up email?

1d2a103,academia,Rant: I feel like I've missed out ,"Rising sophomore at a T10 undergrad studying math + stats, and I feel like all my peers/acquaintances interested in pursuing a PhD in a related field are miles ahead of me. I have so much anxiety about my future because a PhD is something I've wanted for a long time and it crushes me to realize that these are the very students I'll be competing with for programs and funding in the future. 

The thing is, I'm doing the best that I can. I maxed out on my course load both semesters of freshman year with difficult upper division classes and have enough units to graduate next year. I got started at a research lab and found an internship for myself, too. Yet, I can't stop putting myself down for all that I have yet to do. 

I know of a couple of students who took graduate classes (yes, in their freshman year) and will probably take a bunch more next year. They came in with a clear vision of what they wanted to study and how they were going to go about it. Unexpectedly, this is because a majority of them have parents with math/stats/cs/ee PhD's who are tenured at elite universities. Their parents fueled their intellectual curiosity at a young age by enrolling them in math olympiads, Euler circle and what not else. 

I feel so petty typing this out, but these past few days I've been wishing my upbringing was different and that my parents pushed me when I was younger. I've always been very ambitious and I was a ""smart"" child; things could have worked out differently for me had I been encouraged to study beyond what was required. I don't know why I'm posting, but I'd like some perspective on things and an outlook to disrupt this negativity. ",2024-05-28 03:29:36,0,32,1,Positive,0.08206654456654458,0,0,2
1cxjbb8,stress,How to stop brain fog?,"When I am stressed my brain just switches off. It is empty. I am not in a dream state as in dissociation. I just feel my brain has fizzed out, there are no thoughts. And recently this has been 24/7.

The issue is, everything stresses me out. Especially workload, however, my workload is not overwhelming, I just always have a lot to do and it is never finished, and recently I have gotten behind in some paper work. I just feel I cannot relax until tasks are complete. I do not take my work home, however, I have a number of things at home that I need to do and if I am asked to do something for instance move my car I feel overwhelmed, especially if I am trying to relax and not do anything for the day. When others within my household (I live with 2 other adults), are going about their day, cleaning and so on, I feel I too need to clean and cannot sit down, and that my relaxation time will be interrupted with a small often reasonable request, and the cycle begins again.

Adding, it isn't procrastination. I have just set limits as to my hours of work, at work and at home, to allow myself relaxation time. But it seems to be causing me more stress. 

I have had dissociation, PTSD and C-PTSD. I can picture traumatic events and I feel I am at peace with these.

I eat healthy, don't drink, and get enough sleep same time every night.

1edza6u,academia,My writing is too robotic (apparently)?,"Hello,

  
So I have been working on a research paper, and since it is a serious project, I have refrained from using ChatGPT or any other AI tools. However, I must confess that I have used these tools to a great extent in the past, which may have significantly affected my writing. So, long story short, despite writing it all myself, the AI detectors are flagging it with some serious percentages. I have been working on this project for a very long time and have put my heart and soul into it. And in this situation, watching my efforts be labelled as AI generated is extremely distressing and disheartening. I tried rephrasing my sentences, but it only gets worse. The more interesting part is that zerogpt, quillbot, and ai content detector are all flagging different sentences. 

  
I do have the version history that serves as proof of my hard work, and I can send it to my professor anytime. However, I believe that this high percentage of AI detection can cause serious problems with the publishing process. I am very stressed about this and am looking for any valuable advice that can help at this time. Since the deadline is too close, I am afraid I can't rewrite everything from scratch, which I doubt would have made any difference anyway since my writing is too mechanical and robotic. I dont know what to do. Can anyone please assist me?

Physical activity is a natural stress reliever. When you engage in regular exercise, your body releases endorphins, often referred to as ""feel-good"" hormones. These endorphins can elevate your mood and reduce stress levels. Whether it's a brisk walk, a challenging workout, or a relaxing swim, find an exercise routine that suits your preferences and schedule.  
  
**4. Art Therapy: Creativity as a Stress Outlet**  
  
Creating art, be it through drawing, painting, or crafting, can be a therapeutic outlet for stress. Engaging in creative activities allows you to express your emotions, thoughts, and feelings in a non-verbal way. Art therapy can help you gain insight into your stressors and find inner peace through creativity.  
  
**5. Nature Walks: Reconnect with the Outdoors**  
  
Spending time in nature is a simple yet highly effective way to reduce stress. The natural world has a calming effect on our minds and bodies. Take a leisurely stroll through a park, forest, or along the beach. The beauty of nature and the tranquility it provides can be a powerful stress antidote.  
  
**6. Deep Breathing: Instant Stress Relief**  
  
Deep breathing exercises are a quick and accessible stress-reduction technique. When stress hits, pause for a moment, close your eyes, and take slow, deep breaths. Deep breathing oxygenates your body and triggers a relaxation response, helping to soothe your nerves.  
  
**7. Progressive Muscle Relaxation: Unwind Your Tension**  
  
Progressive muscle relaxation is a systematic technique that involves tensing and then releasing different muscle groups in your body. It helps you become more aware of physical tension and can lead to profound relaxation. Practice this technique regularly to unwind your stress-induced muscle tightness.  
  
**8. Aromatherapy: Scented Serenity**  
  
Aromatherapy harnesses the power of essential oils to calm your mind and reduce stress. Scents like lavender, chamomile, and eucalyptus are known for their relaxing properties. Use essential oils in a diffuser, add a few drops to a warm bath, or apply them topically for a fragrant stress-relief experience.  
  
**9. Journaling: Self-Reflection for Stress Management**  
  
Keeping a journal is a powerful way to reflect on your thoughts and emotions. Writing down your worries, fears, and stresses can help you gain clarity and perspective. It's a form of self-therapy that allows you to process your feelings and find solutions to your stressors.  
  
**10. Social Connection: The Power of Relationships**  
  
Human connections are essential for reducing stress. Spending time with loved ones, sharing your concerns, and receiving emotional support can alleviate tension. Don't hesitate to lean on your friends and family when stress becomes overwhelming.  
  
**In conclusion,** stress is a part of life, but it doesn't have to control your well-being. By incorporating these stress-busting activities into your daily routine, you can reduce tension naturally, improve your overall quality of life, and regain control of your emotional and physical health. Remember, the key to effective stress management is consistency. Experiment with these techniques, find what works best for you, and make them a part of your daily life. Embrace the power of these natural stress-busting activities and take the first step towards a more balanced, relaxed, and fulfilling life.",2023-10-16 04:05:42,8,1,1,Positive,0.14592846270928456,0,0,2

Agency life is notorious for burnout, and I've hit my wall. 

My current role was supposed to be a breath of fresh air. I was hired to lead the strategy for our content team, but instead of focusing on strategy and vision, I've been pulled into operations, client management, and even design. It's a far cry from what I signed up for.

The company has gone through a ton of internal changes since I was hired roughly \~3 years ago. We've let go of a lot of staff, and leadership has pushed the responsibilities of the team members that we've ""lost"" on to the remaining employees instead of hiring out. I spend a majority of my work week on operations, client and account management, copywriting, graphic designing, etc, and not much at all on what I was hired to do. 

I was lured to this position by promises of a supportive culture, but that hasn't been the case. I can admit I've been a people-pleaser, taking on more and more responsibilities out of fear of losing my job. Now, I'm desperately trying to break into an in-house role.

I've applied to hundreds of positions, tailored resumes, crafted cover letters, and showcased my work through reels and portfolios. Despite strong experience and a solid network/connections, I'm hitting roadblocks.

1ehzzln,careeradvice,Career Advice Needed: Transitioning from Digital Marketing (8 Years Ago) to Data Analytics After Working in Warehousing (More details in the thread),"Eight years ago, I had a career in digital marketing, where I was quite accomplished—I worked as a Digital Marketing Executive in my last role I had 5 years of experience in that field. However, due to the war in my country and the uncertainty it brought, I developed severe anxiety. When I moved to Canada, my untreated anxiety spiraled out of control. At the time, I didn’t realize that I had PTSD, nor did I understand that it was a treatable condition. I thought my life was over; I was depressed, anxious, suicidal, and struggled with drug addiction.

For over three years, I survived by taking warehouse jobs, doing whatever I could just to get by. Eventually, I learned about my condition and began therapy. Over the next three years, I continued working in warehouses, where I struggled to keep a job. Despite the challenges, things gradually started to improve. With the help of therapy and by reigniting my passion for data analysis—the part of my marketing job I enjoyed the most—I began teaching myself new skills. I worked on projects and continued to learn, and now I’ve reached a point where I’ve acquired enough skills to start a career in data analysis.

I’m currently looking for entry-level positions (not to be confused with data entry), and I’m hoping to leverage my digital marketing experience as domain knowledge to enhance my prospects in data analysis. However, I’m facing a few challenges:

* **Explaining My Career Transition:** How do I explain to potential employers that I transitioned from being a Digital Marketing Executive with five years of experience to working in a warehouse for nearly five years?
* **Poor Attendance:** My attendance in my last job was poor, as I often missed a day each week to focus on developing my data analysis skills.
* **Employment Gaps:** I have significant gaps in my work history, largely because I disliked my warehouse job, felt unappreciated, and saw it as a dead end.
* **Relevance of Marketing Experience:** Can I still use my experience in digital marketing after being out of the field since early 2016? While my knowledge might seem outdated, I believe the fundamentals—especially in PPC and SEO—remain the same.

And how do I tackle this (and reflect it) on my resume, cover letter, interview and LinkedIn profile (it's a big part of the hiring process).

1ddugrw,university,Stuck Between University Choices – Need Advice!,"
I completed my A-levels (Physics, Chemistry, Math, Urdu) this year from Beaconhouse and got decent grades in O-levels (6A\*, 3A) and AS (3 As, 1 B). I also scored 1460 on the SAT. I had done multiple internships and had a lot of ECAs so I applied to every university possible here in Pakistan and abroad. I got into IBA, Habib with an 80% scholarship, the University of Melbourne (50% scholarship), and received three full rides to the US and Hong Kong.

Basically, I had everything sorted.

Now the problem is, my mother won't let me go anywhere outside Karachi since there's no one to support the family if I'm not there (my father passed away due to COVID in 2021). I had a childhood dream of studying aeronautical engineering, aiming for NUST, but I've heard the PNEC campus here isn't great, and the college life is terrible.

Looking at the situation of universities in Karachi, I personally want to pursue any engineering field as long as it's not related to chemistry. I don't want to do computer science either, as it isn't considered an ""engineering"" degree, and my family pressures me to be an ""engineer."" At this point, I'm unable to decide what to do, so I'm listing down the universities I got admitted to and what attracts or concerns me about them. I need advice regarding which university I should pursue and why.

# IBA

* **Pros**:
   * Best University for Business in Pak (beside LUMS)
   * Beautiful campus
   * Good social life
   * Active Student Societies
* **Cons**:
   * Not an engineering major as I got into BBA
   * Switching majors might not be viable for me
   * Don't want to do CS either
   * Interested in BSACF followed by ACCA but uncertain about career prospects

# Habib University

* **Pros**:
   * 80% scholarship
   * Options for EE or CE
   * Summer program opportunities at Stanford and other universities
   * Beautiful campus
* **Cons**:
   * No alumni network as it's new
   * Poor campus management and faulty EE lab equipment (talked to a student there)
   * Campus shuts down at 6 PM
   * Limited social life due to hectic classes and few events
   * Overly strict rules, including attendance being sent to parents

# PNEC-NUST

* **Pros**:
   * Part of NUST (Best Engineering Uni in PAK, #351 in QS World Ranking)
   * Offers Mechanical Engineering, with potential for further studies in Aerospace Engineering
* **Cons**:
   * Feels like a cadet college
   * NUST students don't consider PNEC as part of NUST
   * Civilian discrimination
   * Poor campus life

# NED University

* **Pros**:
   * Strong alumni network
   * Offers Mechanical Engineering, with potential for further studies in Aerospace Engineering
   * Employers and recruiters prefer NED graduates
* **Cons**:
   * Outdated department conditions (wooden chairs, chalkboards)
   * Outdated syllabus
   * Too much freedom, resulting in mediocre campus events and life

Besides these, there's KSBL but again, it is for business and KIET (offers avionics engineering but seems like a farmhouse). I'm really confused and feeling helpless to the point of depression. I would appreciate any advice or insights on which university I should choose and why?!?!?.",2024-06-12 01:10:51,3,0,1,Positive,0.03999238415905083,0,0,2

178v99v,stress,Do you find yourself constantly worrying? This helped me ⬇︎,"**Do you find yourself constantly worrying?**

  
You're not alone.  

  
I used to be trapped in a cycle of negative thoughts.  

  
Constant worry:    
• Stole my joy   
• Ruined my sleep   
• Drained my energy   
• Started my anxiety   
• Affected my well-being    
**But a simple habit changed my life.** 

   
But first, I want you to understand why we worry so much. 

   
In our brain, a small almond-shaped part called the amygdala helps us process fear.  

  
Think of it as your brain's ""alarm system"".  

  
Its job is to keep you safe.  

  
The problem is it's biased towards negativity.  

  
Psychologists discovered some shocking odds in experiments conducted at the University of California, Berkeley. 

   
**9 to 1.**  

  
That's the odds that our brains notice negative versus positive things.  

Let's think about that again:  We take in as many as 9 pieces of negative information for every positive one that gets through.  

  
You'd bet on a horse every time with those odds.    
**But, when we meditate or practice slow breathing, activity in our amygdala reduces.**    


Professionals believe that this occurs due to the “hyperpolarization” of neurons, which makes them harder to excite.    


Literally, calming your mind.    
**Here’s a simple and effective breathing practice to quiet your negative mind:**    


I like this technique because you can do it anywhere.    


• Close your mouth   
• Breathe through your nose    


Place your tongue on the roof of your mouth behind your top teeth.    


• Inhale for 5/6 secs   
• Exhale for 5/6 secs    


Start with 5 mins, and work your way up to 20 mins a day.    


Breathe and break free from the chains of worry.

I am curious, can anxiety or stress cause these symptoms? I slept the whole day and my neck, back, and hips were killing me. I also had really bad chest pains for a while. I feel weak and tired, I also pick up the slack of almost everyone I work with and am absolutely exhausted. Can tell if it’s the flu, covid, or maybe just stress? I drink pretty often as well and am on a migraine injection called anjovy for basolar artery migraines. Please help I don’t know what’s wrong and this is my first day off since last Thursday and this is what’s happening to me. I work tomorrow afternoon, would like to know if I should see a doctor but want to be educated a little before.

If anyone has any info that would help me out a ton, thanks.",2024-07-09 02:25:51,2,1,1,Negative,-0.08413919413919412,0,0,0
1b6kdql,stress,Any tips on controlling stress?,"So, I'd say I have a problem with stress, especially with controlling it. I think it might be starting to affect my health, so I want to do something about it. I always get stressed, even for the smallest things. I'd say I have some sort of Social anxiety, but not really. I am most definitely an extrovert and I mostly don't have a problem speaking to people. But sometimes it's so nerve-racking. Also, public speaking is my worst nightmare. I know, almost nobody likes it, but I feel like I'm near death before public speaking. I hate presentations or saying anything in class. It's most likely something to do with my self-confidence. I also have a fear of being judged and failing, which plays a massive part in the stress. I don't think this is bad enough to go to a therapist, I mean I could, but honestly, I'm scared and would most definitely be stressed to go there lol. I always try to tell myself ''What's the worst that could happen?'' or ''Who cares what they think'' but it just doesn't help, like at all. I think it wouldn't be so bad if I knew how to control my stress. Any help is appreciated!",2024-03-04 19:54:02,10,9,1,Negative,-0.07516666666666666,0,0,0
1eo7xqo,careeradvice,Feeling guilty about quitting my job for one offering 10k more,"I started working for a small company about 7 months ago. Everyone is super nice and seems to care about each other. No micromanagement or being overworked. 

However, after working there for a bit I realized the company is in the market to sell due to not being profitable enough. leadership is somewhat old and incompetent and there have been no successful projects in years. Everything is over-budget and the review process is honestly pretty concerning considering the field I work in is power and mistakes can be very dangerous and costly. 

We just got bought out by a larger successful company! But I’m involved with a project that’s kind of a shitshow (I’m doing design and project management which 1. I don’t have enough experience to do project management and 2. I cannot do both at the same time). 

a few weeks ago our boss pulled the team in in for a meeting to talk about why the project is so overbudget and not progressing.  He brought up that our jobs might be at risk if things continue to be that way and we will have some explaining to do to the new company. The team immediately gave me support and actually helped me complete the project. It’s worth noting no one pointed the blame at me, the boss said the project has been going on since 2021 and about 7 people have touched it without progress. They’re not known to fire people though, even the most incompetent ones haven’t been fired so I’m not sure if boss said what he said to raise some pressure and a sense of urgency. 

I was kind of freaked out so I started applying to other jobs. One of them offered me 10k more and it’s at a large profitable company that seems to have a better grip on processes. But the Glassdoor reviews mentioned a lot of overwork and uncompensated overtime, and some sexism (both reasons are why I left my initial job to come work at the small company). 

I don’t know if I should take the offer, I feel like I’m stabbing my team in the back especially after they helped me so much and also I’m not sure if the company that bought us out would bring in new people to support, or just fire us for the past projects. What would you do?

1er10gn,careeradvice,Useful skills?,"Hi everyone!

I’m a 19 yr old college sophomore. While I currently major in psychology and am considering either going the full route to becoming a therapist which is what I’m more confident in. Or using my 4 yr degree to then apply to PA school or maybe even nursing school (altho nursing is unlikely).

However, maybe due to social media I’m feeling this dooming stress where a little voice in the back of my head keeps telling me I don’t have any acquired skills.
I’m not sure why but random hands on careers have always felt fun to me (even though I was and am one of those kids who would get stressed out at the idea of building a car or something bc I never wanted to fail in my elementary STEM classes). 
As of right now and kind of randomly the last couple months, I’ve considered somehow learning about mechanical like how cars work, electrician stuff, or even coding. I don’t even think I necessarily want a career in these things, I just wish I knew the basics so that like if I went to the dealership to get my car fixed, I wouldn’t get scammed. And like so I could maybe change my oil on my own yk. Altho tbh a small part of me wants to learn skills also as a fallback plan to make extra money in times of struggle. 

I honestly don’t know if learning any of this stuff is relevant. I guess I just wished I knew more about the stuff around me just in everyday life maybe because of how clueless I feel like I am since I have been coddled my whole life.

So yea if I’m just looking for advice abt my dilemma, and if I’m just completely overthinking, or if what I’m thinking is valid. Thank you in advance for your help!!

1djp0q9,academia,Need Advice on Unfair PhD Thesis Evaluation Process,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out in deep distress regarding my PhD thesis evaluation process. Over six and a half years, I've dedicated myself to studying Business Administration in China as an international student from Ethiopia. Despite my significant efforts and several successful reviews, I'm facing an unfair situation that may prevent me from receiving my degree.

As per the university's rule and regulation, students can only submit their thesis for external review three times. In the first round, it's sent to five reviewers, and passing all is necessary. If any fail, a second round with one or two reviewers follows. Failing one in the second round leads to a third round with five new external reviewers, all of whom must pass the thesis.

Here’s a summary of my external review journey:

First External Review: Received scores of 88%, 83%, 80%, 78%, and 56%.

Second External Review: Despite addressing all comments, I received 84% from a new reviewer and only 58% from the original failing reviewer.

Third External Review: Five new reviewers gave scores of 92%, 85%, 65%, 60%, and 58%. The reviewer who gave 58% acknowledged the thesis's innovation but still failed me.

The passing mark is 60%. Interestingly, in the same university, the other school submits to one reviewer if any score is below 60% in the second round. I don’t understand why my case was sent to two reviewers in the second round.

The degree office suggested I appeal to the school, but my appeal received no response, forcing me into an unnecessary third round.

I feel this situation is deeply unfair and does not reflect the quality of my work. If anyone has advice or has faced a similar situation, I would deeply appreciate your guidance. I'm in deep pain and confusion, hoping to find a fair resolution.

 

Thank you for your support.",2024-06-19 17:35:59,0,3,1,Negative,-0.02005256648113791,0,0,0
1atbvzt,stress,What if we Re-framed Our Mental Health Issues?,"So, what do we mean by ’re-frame’?   
  
In its simplest form, re-framing is about looking at a topic from a different – more resourceful - perspective. We can re-frame ‘I’m too old to do that’ to ‘I have all this experience to make a success of that.’ We can re-frame ‘I can’t do that’ to ‘Once I have developed this capability, I’ll be doing that easily.’  
  
Consider this re-frame of many (definitely, not all) of our mental health issues: re-frame ‘mental health issues are rooted in bio-chemical abnormalities’ to ‘mental health issues are a predictable response to living in contradiction of our true nature.’     
  
There is nothing new, or controversial, in saying that many aspects of our modern lives are out of kilter with our natural, evolutionary, legacy. In his 1969 publication, ‘The Human Zoo’, Desmond Morris explored how we respond to modern life’s pressures (such as they were in the 60’s, now they are turbo-charged) from a zoologist’s perspective. Especially, he noted that under normal conditions, in their natural habitats, wild animals do not mutilate themselves, attack their offspring, develop stomach ulcers, suffer from obesity, or commit murder.   
  
Among human city-dwellers, sadly, all these things occur. Does this, then, reveal a basic difference between the human species and other animals? At first glance maybe, but this is deceptive. Other animals do behave in these ways under certain circumstances, namely when they are confined in the unnatural conditions of captivity. The zoo animal in a cage exhibits the abnormalities that we know so well from our human companions. Clearly – he concluded - the city is not a concrete jungle: it is a human zoo.  
  
The comparison we must make is not between the city-dweller and the wild-animal, but between the city-dweller and the captive animal. Modern humans are no longer living in conditions natural for our species. In our cities and lifestyles, we have set ourselves up in huge, unpredictable, menageries where we are in constant danger of cracking under the strain.  
  
Jumping forward 40 years, The Global Burden of Disease’ study, carried out by the Seattle - based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, as published in The Lancet (2012) identified the underlying issues behind world’s top health problems. From a different perspective the massage is the same: we pay a price for ignoring our evolutionary legacy. The underlying causes of the world’s top health problems are not unfortunate bio-chemical abnormalities: they are a function of how we choose to live our lives. That we have the agency to make different choices is a cause for optimism. (I have posted a more detailed piece on this study on my own little corner of the Redditsphere).  
  
Much of what passes for normal in our society is neither healthy nor natural. So much of our normality – set against our evolved needs – takes us off-balance, harming us on the physiological, psychological, and spiritual levels.  
   
Consider what has been normalised about health and illness through this re-frame. When we see the current normal as not the way things are meant to be, we see the possibility of re-aligning with our evolutionary legacy.  
  
So, if we re-frame much maladies not as a cruel twist of bio-chemical fate but rather, a consequence of abnormal, unnatural circumstances, it could have profound implications for how we manage our personal wellbeing. Ailments would no longer be regarded as expressions of individual pathology but as indications of where individually and societally we have gone wrong. Looking through this re-framed lens offers the potential for improving our own wellbeing and our societys’ more generally.  
  
Ever more convincingly, the science is showing that health and illness are not random states in a particular body or body part. Maladies often express an entire life lived, they make sense not in isolation but as a function of circumstances, relationships, genetics, epigenetics, experiences, and choices.  
  
So, assuming the above re-frame has a degree of credibility: this is what working with a (non-medicalised) helper looks like:  
  
•	Re-frame ‘What is wrong with you?’ to ‘What happened to you?’  
•	Re-frame ‘What are your symptoms?’ to ‘How have you adapted to what happened to you?’  
•	Re-frame ‘Helping focused on individual symptoms and behaviours’ to ‘Helping focused on the whole person, recognising they are living within systems that impact them.’  
•	Re-frame ‘Clients are sick, ill, or bad’ to ‘People are generally doing the best they can, given their circumstances.’  
•	Re-frame ‘Medics are the experts so they take control’ to ‘Helpers collaborate to support the client in developing their agency.’  
•	Re-frame ‘Outcomes are set by the medic’ to ‘Outcomes are agreed between the client and the helper.’  
•	Re-frame ‘Help is focused on managing symptoms to ‘Help is focused on implementing solutions for sustainable wellbeing.’  
  
If you are experiencing some form of malady presently, consider these re-frames: how would they help you achieve and sustain your long-term wellbeing? How would they help you better than the current provision.

My mom and dad share one room, my older sister has her own, and me and my brother share the last. The last person, my grandmother, has a bed outside in the living room.

However, in the past few years I’ve gotten increasingly sensitive to loud noises due to anxiety, and my brother has always been loud.

It works, kind of, because it muffles/blocks out most of the sound my brother makes, and my grandma doesn’t sleep at home at night due to work. However, two days ago she quit her job and is now sleeping at home.

I tried moving back to my room to sleep, but my brother is still making so much noise and the light from his pc stops me from getting any sleep, so I have to move to the COUCH outside to sleep.

In addition to that, my grandma also SNORES. I’m so sick of everything there’s no way to escape from the noise when I’m trying to sleep, I feel like I’m going to break down and cry at some point",2024-08-03 15:41:07,4,5,1,Positive,0.03681123403345625,0,0,2

1cobuaq,stress,Stress Boiling Over,"I have definitely gotten myself into this situation. I knew better than to trust my mom, but I hoped against all that she had changed. Now my stress levels feel too much to handle. How do I manage my stress???

Let me explain how everything started. I, 26F, moved in with my mom, 54, plus my niece and nephew, ages 14 and 10. I moved in with them to help my mom financially and to help her raise the kids. Our agreement when I moved in was that I’d take care of all of the utilities while she covered the rent.

She screwed me over when she quit her job and stopped working, leaving me to try to cover all of the expenses which was well over my income. She was already behind on rent (found this out later). The 12 grand (USD) she got from income taxes that was supposed to pay me back and help us, she used it all on drugs. In one week for that matter.

Long story short, we ended up getting evicted, becoming homeless. My dog and cat, being forced to live in a car. A month later and things are finally looking up. I’m close to hopefully getting a place, I’m working on getting custody of the kids, and I’m hoping to get my babies(my dog and cat) back into a stable home away from my mom.

1ejj6q5,careeradvice,I want to quit my job so badly,"Hey, I'm writing here because I need some advice, I apologize if it's a long read but I want you to understand my situation in depth.

I recently got a job as a tracer for a trucking company honestly it sucks, the reason why it sucks, in my opinion, is because half the time I'm just staring at the screen watching trucks on Samsara and google maps. The whole point of the job is to keep track of trucks and update brokers and dispatchers if anything happens.

The majority of people at the workplace are miserable and pissed off, not to mention I'm the youngest person there as everyone is over the age of 30. I can't find a connection with them and I don't want to honestly everyone pretty much hates each other and I always hear someone talking shit about someone else. Not to mention the shifts are all over the place where sometimes I would randomly work night shifts, and morning shifts. Also, there are cameras in every room monitoring us and I can't help but feel uncomfortable having someone watching me work every second.

My first job was as a broker for a freight company for about 3 months, I enjoyed it at first but quickly got overwhelmed with the work and got ""let go"" without any warning or a second chance. it was a shame because I did like the atmosphere and the people working there were friendly and easygoing. My second job was fleet management but I left halfway through the training as the trainer was terrible at explaining the job and at times didn't even seem interested in teaching me.

Now it's my second month as a tracer and all I think about is quitting as this line of work, this whole trucking field is not for me I think I've given the whole trucking experience a try personally and I don't just don't see myself doing this in the future. I'm sick of these office jobs and honestly want to switch to something else, the only reason I chose to work is that I needed money and money alone but you see that is also a problem as I don't want to work at some job I have no will to work for money. I'm scared to waste my life on something I'll regret and by the time I try to change, it'll be too late. I know I sound dramatic but I've started to think about my life and where my path will lead me ever since I turned 20.

Unfortunately, I do not have anything lined up as these jobs are popular here and it's rare to find something else. I have two options, I can stay and work as much as I can while looking for a new job or I could quit now and fully commit to finding something and take a mental break for a while. It might take months but I'm determined to find a job not for the sake of earning but to keep.

""What is your dream job or goal?"" Might sound strange but I don't have a dream job, but I'm interested 3d animating, music, I even thought about being a zoo keeper. I love animals and the thought of working at a zoo isn't that bad, to be honest. Now it might take some time and I might need to job-hop a little but whatever it takes.

""Why don't you talk to your family about it?"" I tried but my father doesn't understand, he said ""Who cares where you work as long as you earn money"" My father has never worked in an office before, he worked his whole life in retail so he obviously doesn't get it. Practically everyone in my family tells me to take whatever job I can get and not to be so picky.

So basically that's my situation again it's a long read but I felt like getting it off my chest and just hearing what you guys think about it all, what would you do in my shoes? Should I quit or stay? Am I sounding like a baby? What would you do differently?

1ei46p9,stress,I am a shallow stressed wreck - what can I do?,"I am a shallow stressed wreck - what can I do?

I’ve had severe stress  few times the past couple of years. It’s _probably_ mostly based on the fact that I earlier did things where I was in full control (IT, construction), and now I’m spending time with managing our small kids, being a people manager at work etc. 

But my work is actually easy, few hours, close and good paying. My kids have some issues (ADD, autistic etc.), but nothing uncommon or wild. 

I have a bunch of physical reaction to stress, including: neck/shoulder pain, jaw pain, stomach pain, diarrhea for months, stress induced tinnitus and fever, vision impairment (don’t feel safe driving cars anymore), severe sleeping issues, general feeling of inflammation in my body. Further, a bunch of psychological reactions, including anhedonia (not feeling anything pleasure), forgetting things and words, going angry easily etc. 

Ended up in hospital last year with severe stomach pain and messed up heart rhythm. After a bunch of testing, everyone said it was just stress. 

Doctors, psychologists, physicians all say I should just relax some more. I’ve spend years with yoga, breath exercises, mindfulness, meditation, long walks in nature, exercising, etc. I’ve tried a bunch of medications. Some may help me sleep for a night, but nothing fixes anything. 

I am sooo tired, my body and mind are sooo tired.

1dbr8qf,university,Is bachelors (undergrad) Business degree a good idea? SPAIN (but any advice from other countries would be helpful too),"Hi I live in Spain and after this summer I will be off to uni. In the next 2-3 weeks I need to make a decision on where to apply. This isn't as last minute as it seems, i have a few bachelors degrees in various fields that interest me i just want to make sure it's definitely what i want to study and will be helpful in the future.

The programs i've been looking into are ""Business administration and management"" ""international business"" and a double degree of ""Tourism and Business administration"". I love that these programs could help me set up my own business in the future and i love the idea of involving languages (I am currently fluent in 4).

The programs l've looked into are mainly made of economics, law, and maths, though im not sure how much math would actually be involved during learning. I've heard some people say that you need to have an incredibly good level of maths to get through the 4-5 years of studying, while others say that math doesn't get too difficult and business degrees are mostly about logic and ""cause effect"".

The reason I'm worried is because for my A-levels and Bachillerato I have only been studying humanities (aside from AS in physics): and those are the subjects that allow me to get into these uni programs in the first place. 

So, Q1: Would i be setting myself up for failure?

My ultimate goal isn't becoming an accountant/finance expert etc but rather understanding how business works and be able to start up something on my own. Q2: Is the business degree worth it? Or should i get a degree in another field? (going to uni is non negotiable with my parents and i would personally love to go myself unless there is a groundbreaking alternative).

Any advice or experience would be much appreciated thank you!",2024-06-09 11:06:05,1,0,1,Positive,0.17533422459893044,0,0,2

1dr8gv5,stress,I can't recognize stress until I'm so tense I'm going to vomit or my hair starts turning white,"I know that sounds dramatic but it's true. Growing up, in my family and even with some of my teachers, they believed (and if they didn't actually believe it then they just acted like they did to get the kids to shut up) that kids could not feel stress. Like they literally could not physically feel stress, that it was impossible because ""kids have everything handed to them and nothing to worry about"", like kids just lacked the capability to feel stressed out either. I'm not even just talking about little kids either, they believed this up until very late teen years and even then they'd laugh at the stress of a 20 or even sometimes 30 something year old because they were ""finally experiencing stress for the first time"".

I was an extremely stressed out kid lmao There are a million reasons why and it would make the post too long, but probably my biggest example was when I was 11 or 12 years old. I already had the worst sleep insomnia by that age and I would literally run on like 3 hours of sleep every day for years and years, if I was lucky and could relax enough for that much. So I was sitting in the car one day and I had one of my usual migraines and I could not even move. Step dad doesn't believe I'm in pain. ""Oh, if it's really that bad, your temples will be throbbing"" he says, the most smug ass, bitch ass smirk imaginable on his face as if he's about to bust me with indisputable proof of lying to just laze around in the car. I don't give a fucking shit, you know why??? Because I already fucking know my temples are throbbing, and you know how I know that??? Because they do literally every single fucking day and I was constantly massaging them and cupping my hands around my eyes to try to create darkness and warmth so my eyes could relax and hopefully stop fucking aching and stabbing so much. So, here he comes with his smug ass smile, I'm already sitting up and leaning forward because I know he's about to be proven fucking wrong and sure enough, he touches my temples and his eyes widen and he's like ""oh wow, she really does."" No fucking apology or anything else, no medicine or taking an early rest or anything else, just ""yep 😐 Get to work anyway"". If you can't tell, I'm still fucking bitter about it. Then again, I should've expected as much considering step bro burned his hand to the point of a huge bubble of his skin protruding from his palm and got ""just rinse it, calm down"" 🤷🏻‍♀️ Anywho, that was probably the worst example I can think of for my own personal stress.

In freshman year I had counselors come to my house, not cuz I was bad or anything lol I was just so sick constantly that I couldn't go to the actual building so they were supposed to teach me anything I needed support with. Anyway, I remember the man and his like assistant kinda girl because I believe it was her who said to my mom, ""she's really stressed"", got cut off by my mom's chortle and promptly shut down with ""she's stressed??? About what??? She's 14!"" and the horrified look on the woman's face. She didn't speak much after that and I always assumed she probably didn't want to make things worse, considering the mere mention of a kid being anything but blissfully grateful was worthy of scorn and contempt.

I always felt so confused and gaslit over this and deep down I guess I knew the truth already and that I was beyond stressed. But, I still deluded myself into believing the adults around me because they always insisted so hard and I thought ""I'm a kid, I must be wrong and dumb. One day when I'm grown up, I'll look back at this and laugh and see how wrong I was."" It's been the complete fucking opposite. There was no disagreeing either, no matter how respectful and sugar coated, because then you were mouthing off and ignorant. When that woman said I was stressed and my mom cut her off, I dead ass looked into her eyeballs with empty, dead pupils and eyebags to my knees, still having constant throbbing temples, nodded and said ""yep, I'm not stressed, I'm a kid."" 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️😭😭😭 BECAUSE IT WAS SO FUCKING DRILLED IN, but somehow I thought ""nah, she's just misunderstanding the sitch"" 🤦🏻‍♀️

I don't know how to identify stress. I don't know how to identify most emotions because I was shouldered with the responsibility of being the strong and mature kid who takes care of everyone and has to be stoic, no emotions or crying, and be the adults' therapist too. I turned off my emotions and was very mean and cold. I was notorious among my real friends for hiding how I really felt about things and bottling it up until I exploded on them with all the emotions hitting me like a freight train and hurting them! And I was already so harsh, rude, callous, insensitive and explosive that when I'd REALLY explode fr it was too much for even the most patient of them. Bless their hearts for never giving up on me 😭🙏🏻😓 That's actually the whole reason I joined Reddit and started my healing journey and curing my DPDR in the first place. I blew up on one of my best friends who I'm basically in love with and she told me she was crying and kept apologizing and it was such a stupid reason to be mad too, I kept saying it was stupid and I wanted to stop but couldn't stop spewing venom in her face and I feel so terrible and I knew I had to change 😓 Anyway the point is, I don't know how to identify emotions and especially stress. I have a lot of aches and pains, obviously the headaches but those aren't as bad nowadays, I also had a shit ton of stomach pain and used to constantly hurl and couldn't eat, I was severely underweight for years and years because of it. I'm so tense all the time and a little over a year ago a friend of mine irl massaged my shoulders and neck and was all shocked over how tense I am, but I've been like this as long as I can remember - _ - Aside from the pains and tension, my hair will also turn white strand by strand when I'm extremely stressed. I think that started as a preteen and used to be just at my ear but now it can be at either ear but mostly the top of my head. When I can relax, it seems to return to normal or otherwise fall out. I'm not talking about chunks or streaks of white, I'm just talking about the strands. Not even noticable really, I hope anyway 🤷🏻‍♀️ It kind of shimmers in the light, there's an inside joke in my family that I'm doing my Rapunzel hair thing but my sister also develops it too but much, much rarer than me because she's almost never stressed. I think she's had it like twice in the last ten years and mine, oh my God I'd have to really count the memories O-o OH YEAH and tmi because I'm the queen of over sharing but my ass is also constantly clenched to the point of big dimples and I don't know how to fucking relax my cheeks. That's partially from physical abuse and partially because of sexual things from childhood 😭 My booty is always so tight my back hurts and crackles. I don't know how to relax my buns 🤷🏻‍♀️ I told my real friends and they tried to help, even sent some links I think, but I just cannot get my bum slack if my life depended on it - _ - Oh yeah and since 2018 I've been clenching my teeth against my will and subconsciously, no grinding and not in my sleep though. Yes, also from stress. I think that's when they finally stfu about young people not having the capability to feel stress, when my jaw was so tight I literally couldn't open my mouth to ""yes, ma'am. No, sir"" them anymore 😑🙄😒

Anyway, yeah, I literally cannot identify stress until I'm so tense I'm going to puke or until my hair turns white. Please help a sis out 😭 And please how the fuck do I relax, like my whole body but especially my guts, jaw and cake? This feels so stupid honestly but whatever, I can't help how I was raised - _ - I'm like that ""is this a butterfly?"" meme with stress - _ - Oh yes, and general calming down of my mind, like anxiety and hypochondria shit, that would be nice too, thanks 👍🏻🙏🏻🙇🏻‍♀️😭

1doeh9j,university,Does the type of law school(university) you go to affect how you get employed in the future?,"Ok so I’m about to start college and I’m doing A level law and 3 other subjects. I want to try and do both environmental law apprenticeship and criminal law in uni after college. My mom and I had an argument about grades and everything. She has very high expectations of me like wants me to just get A+ on everything and 90% and all that and I don’t. Not saying I want to fail, I will study hard but would be more happy with just a general pass rather than super excellent high end grades like that. So she said that I will need to get those high end grades if I want to go into a nice university that offers law because if I don’t and just go to an ordinary university then I’ll fail. And this is like stressing me out, she’s and African parent and I keep trying to tell her like it don’t matter as long as I get good normal grades and attend a general law school but she keeps being rigid about it and talking down on me and saying I’ll send you back to Zimbabwe and you’ll do college there(we came to the uk from Zimbabwe getting citizenship next year) and uhh ye. I know I rambled on and on but what she said about “if I don’t get into a top top university then I won’t be able to get into a good job” got me thinking like is this true? So law schools teach different things like does it really matter? Will law firms pick people just because they have gone to a prestigious school and gotten highest good grades I guess and people who haven’t gotten the highest good grades but still good are just left and not picked?",2024-06-25 19:28:30,2,1,1,Positive,0.2128713450292398,0,0,2
1bzla8n,stress,The Impact of Positive Partner Support on Stress Relief,"Welcome to \[Listen2.AI\](https://listen2.ai).
Listen here: https://go.listen2.ai/3Ua4cj7

Researchers over at Binghamton University stumbled upon some heartwarming findings that reinforce the age-old adage, ""Behind every successful person, there is a supportive partner."" We always knew that a little encouragement from our spouses could go a long way, but who knew it could actually alter our hormonal stress responses? The study, focusing on 191 married heterosexual couples, found out that not just any support, but positive support from our partners could lead to significantly lower levels of cortisol – that pesky stress hormone that likes to make itself known at the most inopportune times.

In an endeavor that sounds a bit like eavesdropping, researchers observed these couples discuss personal, non-marital issues over two 10-minute sessions. By scrutinizing these conversations, they gauged the levels of support provided and received, paying close attention to the nature of that support – whether it was perceived positively or negatively. Moreover, they didn’t just stop at observation; they went on to collect saliva samples to measure cortisol levels, adding a tangible, biological layer to their findings.

Interestingly, the study found that women who perceived the support they received more negatively felt less understood and validated, leading to a spike in their cortisol levels. On the flip side, when partners demonstrated positive support skills – like understanding, validating, and caring – cortisol levels tended to drop. Dr. Richard Mattson, the lead researcher, highlighted the stress-amplifying effect of negative receptions of support, emphasizing how our perceptions play a crucial role in this dynamic.

Hayley Fivecoat, the brains behind this study and now a clinical research psychologist, pointed out a critical factor – the cumulative effect of how supportive we perceive our partners to be over time. This general perception can drastically shape how we view specific behaviors in the moment, suggesting that what we bring into a relationship in terms of expectations can also influence our stress responses.

What does this mean for us, moving forward? Well, understanding the nuanced interplay between support, perception, and stress could pave the way for not only stronger relationships but also for healthier individuals. It also beckons further research into how diverse couples experience and leverage support, the tone versus the content of supportive communications, and even how different cortisol measurement techniques might offer new insights into effective partner support.

In closing, while the study might currently only cover heterosexual married couples, its implications stretch far and wide. As we understand more about how support dynamics function within relationships, we're likely to uncover more universally applicable strategies to bolster our collective well-being. It’s a fascinating glimpse into the biochemistry of love and support, and a reminder that sometimes, the best stress relief comes not from a pill, but from a partner’s affirming words or a listening ear.

1elqihr,careeradvice,I feel stuck in advertising sales in my mid-30s and don't know what to do for a career change. I feel overwhelmed and paralyzed.,"I initially went to college to study journalism and film criticism, driven by my passion for cinema and writing. However, as newspapers began to decline, I switched my major to Telecom in my senior year, aiming for media production. After graduation, I struggled to find relevant work and ended up in a retail supervisory position for a year, followed by a stint at a bank where I hoped to join their marketing department through a management trainee program. When that didn't work out, I took a job in advertising sales, expecting a marketing role, but instead found myself cold calling from day one. That's how I fell into sales.

I enjoy building client relationships and excel at account management, but I dislike cold calling. I've been working in TV advertising sales for the past 7yrs, and made President's Club a few years ago and have generally always done well to budget, but it's a tough sell in 2024, and I'm feeling burnt out. The focus has shifted entirely to new business, neglecting the account management side I love. I'm having my first bad year (political season has caused a lot of clients to stop running, I also had some churn on larger accounts for the first time because people are pulling money from TV), just got assigned a new manager who I'm not really getting great vibes from, and I worry about being put on a performance plan or even fired if things don't improve.

I'm uncertain about my next steps. While I don't want to stay in sales unless it's something I'm passionate about, I struggle to find a clear direction. I'm interested in health, nutrition, wellness, film, and music, but unsure how these passions could translate into a fulfilling sales role. I've thought about trying to find something in tech or healthcare but I just don't even know what I should be looking for tbh. The idea of leaving sales altogether also crosses my mind, but I lack decisiveness about what else to pursue, leaving me feeling lost and aimless. This uncertainty has led to self-destructive patterns recently (slipping back into more regular weekend drinking and stuff like that), and anxiety about my professional future.

Does anyone have suggestions for industries or roles where I could apply my account management skills? I need a change soon, as I can't continue in my current situation much longer. Just feel like I have no idea what to do or where to look.",2024-08-06 19:17:26,1,0,1,Positive,0.03582307449494951,0,0,2

1epvmyl,careeradvice,Manager irritating and harassing me. What do i do?,"Hello I work at a FANG software company. My boss recently has been very much getting on my nerves to the point that it is causing extreme emotional distress on the daily. I am a female and i have been in the industry for around 8 years. Recently, my boss keeps making rude, and often uncanny, hyberbolic statements relating to my work. For example, saying things like ""my takeaway is that you haven't done anything"" and then proceeding to lecture me in front of my peers during our standup meetings about clearly documenting work. This is absolutely distasteful as I have multiple documents, and pages of documented work from my day to day dating back months. He has access to these and ive directed it towards him multiple times he just ignores it. Meanwhile there are multiple people on my team that haven't written a single word about their work. But it is clearly targeted towards me and me only. He is purely saying it to be spiteful and build a case against me and make me look back to my peers.

My belief is that it's because i do have a physical illness that requires me to work from home despite the company initiative to drive people back into the office. I suffer from a disorder that sometimes leaves me bedridden, but it doesn't necessarily stop my ability to work but sometimes I will have to take off of work and last year i had to take a whole month off because of it. I have been able to clearly work though, and i do get my work done and do what im asked to do. But i believe he is trying to slowly build up a case against me.

He spends a lot of time making very rude remarks, often micromanaging my behavior, and lecturing me about very trivial things for no clear reason. Like a few days ago he made some rude remarks about me using the company internal meeting tool instead of using outlook. There is no downside to using this tool, in fact me and my peers only use this tool. It was clearly just a display of power and served no purpose to our discussion but to assert dominance over me.

I dont know what to do, or how to bring this up to HR or if there really is anything i can do. It is getting to the point where he will make a comment in our meetings and im getting so distressed by it that i cant work or think straight and im having to take off work just to manage the frustration and anger this individual brings me.

And yes, before you say it, i have brought it up on multiple occasions to him in attempts to try and tell him how i feel but he gaslights me and plays victim every time.

What do i do? Do i quit? Do i talk to hr? I really dont want to quit because ive been sending out resumes for the last month and havent even gotten an interview. I think the job market is really not good right now so i feel i have no choice but to just accept this abuse.",2024-08-11 21:12:44,1,0,1,Negative,-0.023944099378881988,0,0,0

1esiwmw,college,Roommate situation,"This might be a dumb question, but should I always leave the room when my roommate gets on the phone? She literally calls her boyfriend and parents multiple times a day and talks for like 30-40 minutes. Whenever she does that, I usually just sit in our common area outside of the bedroom to give her some privacy. One time I accidentally came inside while she was on the phone and she looked at me weird. I've never tried to eavesdrop before so I don't know why she's doing this. Should I just keep leaving when she calls? For context, we're both freshmen and moved in pretty recently. Classes haven't started yet. We already met before in person before move in and she seemed chill. 

There's also another issue besides the phone thing. We got along pretty well when we first met in person, but I feel like we aren't really friends yet. I'm always the one that starts our conversations, and we barely talk to each other. Our convos are also pretty short. I can't tell if she's an introvert or if she just doesn't like me. I haven't done anything bad or weird as far as I know. I always try to be considerate. I'm not really sure if she's an introvert because I saw her chatting with other random people at our orientation at summer camp. I also sometimes ask her if she wants to get lunch together or go swimming. She always says no. She also makes up excuses. Like for example, today she said she can't go swimming with me because she wants to go to the ""bowling alley on campus."" I was super surprised and looked it up. I couldn't find anything about it, and I doubt it exists. 

Additionally, she also wants to bring her boyfriend over and have him sleep in our room. I'm kinda uncomfortable, but I said I'm fine with it because I don't want to make the situation worse. I'm mostly just paranoid in general. I'm worried that he'll steal something from my room. I have some valuables in there like my laptops, other electronics, jewelry, etc. I've never actually met her boyfriend before or talked to him.

I'm not going to attempt to switch roommates because she seems chill. I'm just trying to figure out where to go from here. 


Edit: I decided to talk to her about the bf thing tomorrow. And she also isn't acting hostile. I just don't think she's very talkative. She was really nice when I first met her and was actually the one that wanted to room with me. ",2024-08-15 01:38:04,33,17,1,Negative,-0.006578947368421044,0,0,0
1enoi5v,careeradvice,"So yesterday I was let go in the middle of my 2 week notice, is this normal? Should I be worried?","Full context I was a team lead for a small company ran by a husband and wife with four locations. I loved my bosses, job, and coworkers. Overall I felt I was well liked and things went smooth. I had just moved out on my own having calculated what I could afford based on the hours I was used to and the minimum that would be okay. I never had even 40 hours a week, but I was doing okay and happy. Recently my hours were shorter, I asked if this was because of training schedules and if I can expect at least my minimum needed weekly hours going forward in August. My employers said yes. The next schedule is up and I'm only getting less than 20 hours. I start panicking and placing in apps to find a second job. By some miracle I land an actual full time job. I placed my 2 weeks intending on it ending on the 12th. I have been alternating both jobs every single day since. On the 3rd a family member ended up hospitalized and I was awake until 7am on the 4th, so I called in from my old job. Yesterday I show up to one of my already very scarce shifts. The girl who is never late is not there. I start setting up, planning my bake, etc. Waiting for her. I go to use the bathroom, and then text her on the work chat to see if she was okay. My app logs me out and when I attempt to log back in I have no account. I hear the door open and wonder if it's my co team lead coming in instead of the other girl. I walk out and the wife is holding my keys, which makes me extremely uncomfortable as she has my house keys in her hands too. Obviously I know which one she wants, and I hand it to her.

1erubol,stress,Ways to deal with high stress (help) ,"This is probably been asked many times, but I really want to know if people have found an effective alternative that may not be drug induced to dealing with high levels of stress.

I was diagnosed with GAD in university and had been dealing with it most of my life. And I didn't even realize how much it was holding me back until I got on Lexapro for the first time. It made just moving and pushing through life so much easier. I was on it for a solid 6 years, and it had really changed me for the best. I've always been a person that certain things that bothered people where he showed signs of distress, I was kind of the opposite, but I think it was because I was in this constant state of anxiety that i would just internalize it. But on Lexapro, I could internalize it, and move on to actually do things. 

But I think I was starting to notice that Lexapro was causing a mental wear on me, that I was worried could affect me long term, so I got off it. I definitely felt like I was just floating through life, and I wasn't feeling as much as I use to. Which I think was for the best. Also sexually, I can't cum on it.  To the point where even now, off Lexapro, it's hard to cum through normal intercourse.  I think it also might've messed up my short term memory. I find it hard to keep track of things being told to me in the present

I also feel like I was kind of putting up a front to people about who I am, when on Lexapro. I realized, off Lexapro I'm way more to myself.  I started to realize that people like me more so on it, then when I'm not on it. Some of these people I realized were kind of people I dont want to be around anyway, but I have even good friends now, who I really have nothing against at all, but I don't want to see them.  I don't want to go out nearly as much, I feel people emotions/feelings way more. I can't concentrate, I lack motivation to even just run through projects and force myself to do things. It also was great at stopping my back pain. Which I find difficult some days to maneuver through now. 

Life got difficult the last 2 years I would say, and I was off Lexapro for all of it. It was bad. But things seem to be building into something better now, but I feel like it would be getting better quicker if I had the motivation/lack of mental block to just push through it. Not disclosing too much about me, a pr  company reached to help me promote my modeling/hip hop that I do. Free of charge. I just have to start making content for tik tok which doesn't even sound that bad. But my brain is just filled with anxiety and doubt about it all. I'm doing music with a friend and he has music video ideas involving me in lead roles with a love interest, and I'm dreading it for that reason.  Like I'm having to put on this ""cool"" persona for the world to see. Then my main lines of work, if I put in a little more effort I could be making more money, but i do care. Which I should, cause I need more cash. 

I feel like I'm trapped in my own self and it's exhausting. And I'm pushing through as much as I can and im burning out. I'm in a foreign country, am behind on finances like taxes, can't afford gym membership now which was an ok way to relieve stress for me (but I should be able to scrap money to pay it shortly), not health insurance so buying meds has become more expensive (and even if I had it, I couldn't be able to afford the monthly expense of it I think) , Im feeling super drained and anti social and also self concious.

I don't want to get back on lex due to the multitudes of side affects, plus what I already stated affects. And I'm worried about the long term affects on my health.  But I've tried everything else supplements, vitamins, diet change, switching jobs I hate to something I like/love, exercising, and it feels like nothing comes even remotely as close to that.  I'm open to other medicine/drug alternatives with lesser side affects if it can make me feel better. 

I feel like many great things are coming up and I'm worried I will miss them because of my mental state.  I also realize this is a regurgitation of thoughts, but I haven't really discussed this feeling with anyone. So I'm using reddit as that outlet 😅. It was kind of nice actually 

TLDR: what are some great ways to help alleviate stress whether it's through pharmaceutical or other alternative means. ",2024-08-14 06:13:21,1,5,1,Positive,0.18512951334379907,0,0,2

The answer would probably vary from country to country but would love to know your experience.  
  
How stressful can a Masters be compared to undergrad?  
  
How do you manage your finances? I am guessing it must be tough being a full time masters student and pay for living expenses. It would be great to know how people live minimalistically, and maybe even have some savings while doing their masters (if thats even possible).  
  
How much time do you have to spend on campus? I am personally aiming to get into a research based masters program which would give me the option to TA as well. If anyone is in a similar position already, would love to know what your day looks like.  
  
Overall, it would be very helpful for me to get an understanding of the life of a masters student, the struggles and how you deal with it.

1d8fv5m,stress,Need advice ,"Hey I need some advice. So I’m in my last sem of uni and I have this one course I need to pass in order to graduate. It is diving into 40% assignments/test and 60% final exam. 

I messed up my first 20% test by not only not doing a good job but also submitting late and the lecturer has not replied if he will accept my assignment. Also we were suppose to submit the hardcopy of our test as well and I did that but I was so nervous and anxious I did not talk to him about how I submitted late the soft copy and if will submit it or not.

To top it all off, the prof is taking a 6% test on our next week’s class that will be exchanged with the 6% of the initial test as no one did well on that. However, I will be unable to attend that class as I am not in the city next week. The 20% group assignment is done but I’m also not sure how it really went. 

Now I know some of you will suggest to talk to the prof but 1) he’s a very rigid prof and 2) I have severe anxiety of talking to my profs about this and messing up. I don’t even know what I will say to him that doesn’t make the situation worse. 

Now I’m left with 60% final exam and I’m so worried I will not be able to get enough to pass and I need to graduate. What should I do? ",2024-06-05 03:05:39,1,2,1,Positive,0.02045454545454545,0,0,2
1eilxzn,stress,Chronic stress is making me ill,"A bit of background: I’m 31 female with 2 boys, a 5 year old and 4 month old. The bio dad of my 5 year old has passed away and I have his family sharing with me to raise him. I’m a PhD student, with 18 months left when I return in September. 

I have had a baby with my current partner (together 3 years) but he has lost his job twice in the last 6 months, the first when I was 36 weeks pregnant and the second a few months ago, causing huge financial strain. We can pay our bills, buy nappies, formula etc and just about eat if we’re careful. I have been in and out of debt with bills over the last 6 months. I am waiting for a start date for a job. As my partner isn’t working at the moment, I don’t have to find childcare to start my job which is a plus. I have no maternity pay due to a zero hour contract with literally no hours for months before my youngest was born. 

I am responsible for most of the housework although he does do some of the care for our baby. I have stopped putting away his laundry but he doesn’t care, he’s happy just picking out of washing baskets. He doesn’t care if the house is messy either, he just tells me to do less. 

I could go on and on about how stressed I am but I’m hoping you get an idea from what I’ve written so far. The only other notable point is that I’m the only driver so I have to be there to go food shopping, appointments etc. 

The stress all this is causing has never been worse. I’m exhausted, my skin condition is flaring up, I’m losing weight fairly rapidly, I’m picking up illnesses very frequently, I had Bell’s palsy which I’m thankfully recovered from, I spend my life in the verge of tears and I’m very snappy recently. I’m also sitting here with 6 cold sores on my bottom lip (which I get when I’m run down) and have been getting pretty heavy nosebleeds, which is new for me. I don’t know how I’ll manage working too but we need the money, then adding uni back into the mix. 

I’m sorry for the long post but this is just my current situation. I don’t know what to do. I can’t stop any single thing because the house won’t be maintained, baby needs care. Please can anyone advise? Also, please, please be kind and don’t judge me too harshly, I’m just trying my best and the kids are happy and healthy.

I’m tempted by the $$$ in the U.S but am afraid of burnout and like the idea of having ample time to bum around Europe, despite having less money.

1duisv6,academia,"Am I delusional for wanting to stay at the same university, post-PhD? ","Hi guys, 

\*Sorry for the long post... might have turned into a bit of a rant.\* 

I'm on the last lap of my PhD, and I love where I work. My supervisors are great, the area of research is my passion, I have lots of independence and flexibility in my research pursuits, and I would love to one day be a faculty member at the university that I'm getting my degree from. 

Currently, I'm exploring my options for postdoctoral positions and funding. My main obstacle is that I do not want to move. Also, I definitely cannot afford to move, even if I have a substantial increase in income and relocation allowance from a hypothetical postdoc position (estimates based off of above-average listings I can find online in my field). The cost of living is just too high and I can only afford to live where I do because there are temporary laws that are preventing our rent from increasing more than a specified percentage. 

In my field, it's expected that you complete 5-ish years of postdoc work before you're a viable candidate for faculty appointment. It is also a strong opinion that postdocs should explore other universities, adjacent fields of research, etc. to gain experience and other perspectives. Aside from my supervisors (who are supportive, but lack funding), every other researcher or authority I've spoke to has repeatedly told me I have to leave and go elsewhere. The university does not support candidates that completed their PhD here.   
  
I'm so goddamn happy and satisfied with where I am and my research, it's kind of frustrating to be told I have to give it up. I'm applying for the few opportunities that I'm eligible for in hopes of getting some funding that lets me stay where I'm at, but I'm feeling discouraged. I don't have a crazy competitive CV. I have some good publications and collaborations, strong letters of support from my supers, but haven't received the top scholarships. I haven't been able to do a whole lot of extra training or any teaching on the side due to financial limitations and institutional rules, respectively. I already work part-time in research and have maxed the number of hours per week that I'm allowed to work, in addition to being a full-time student. Some volunteer work, maybe teaching, could add to my CV, but I'm also trying to balance things so that I don't get too overwhelmed and have a mental breakdown. 

I feel like I'm getting to my wits end. Is academia only for the financially secure and/or middle to upper class? Was I naive to pursue research as a lower class person? Is it wrong to think there should be more support (social, not financial) for students who can't afford to travel the world (or even country) for research experience? Maybe I'm being entitled thinking I should be able to have these things? Sure, I have skills and abilities that got me to this point, but lot's of other people do too, plus they already have the money help them. I'm not blind to the fact that I'm a bit of an outlier with my background. I had a lot of luck help me get here; the opportunities for post-secondary, my supervisors getting funding right as I was considering graduate studies, and so on. 

I love what I'm doing so much, and I've been able to network and have international collaborations thanks to the ease of online meetings. I work with lots of individuals globally and feel I get good experience that way. I just don't see the requirement to physically move and change universities. 



Does anyone have any advice? General words of encouragement are welcome as well. 

------------------------

Extra info that might help:   
  
- Married without children, no plan on having kids.  
- Spouse can't relocate with their current employer and doesn't have good employment options elsewhere. They did not do any post-secondary education.   
- Our city has some other universities, but none of them do research in the area or general field that I am in.   
- I did not go straight to university after high school; I have diverse life experiences/employment.    
- Neither of our families can provide any financial support.  
- We're both from lower class backgrounds; I'm from significant poverty (ie. food insecurity, homelessness)   
- There are no government programs to assist us that we haven't already used/tried to apply for (but feel free to suggest things, maybe I'm wrong. The country is Canada).   
- I am considered a permanently disabled person/student due to mental disorders and conditions.    
- I'm straight and white. Not a visible or historically excluded minority.   
- I have a fuck-ton of student debt that will likely be paused for repayment when I graduate, considering income and cost of living, so I'll hopefully tackle that after my postdoc researcher years. ",2024-07-03 16:35:53,7,10,1,Positive,0.15011069099676694,0,0,2

1eo9l7g,careeradvice,Job changing while waiting for home purchase to close? ,"I have a bit complicated situation that I am quite stressed about/ feel bad:

Background:

 I am currently have an apartment purchase pending… hopefully close in a few weeks time. At this current job (A) that I have been with for more than 2 years, I found out earlier this year I was on their layoff list so I started interviewing for practice at my own pace. Earlier this week, I have secured a position with a quasi-government agency in my state (B) that is very reputable and the money & benefits are just good to say no. They are very understanding of my mortgage situation and can wait till 9/23. Then I do have a 3 week notice period in my contract with A. Here are really a few scenarios:

 1.  If my closing date can be before 8/30 (50% chance, everyone is trying hard though), then I can give the notice and complete my 3 week notice period 

2.If my closing date is between 8/30 – 9/23, then I won’t be able to give 3 week notice. Not sure how this would turn out. My manager and I are in a really good relationship and I feel so guilty that I am going to screw him over

3. Look into this with my bank -  They did say if prior to closing they found I have a new job then I will need to provide additional details and at least 1 pay stub. I just wonder if there is a chance because this new job comes with more money and being a public sector it provides more job security.

I am definitely tackling this with caution to not risk my purchase and earnest deposit… but really I want to also move on and leave my current job so that is also a good opportunity for me to jump the ship….

Has anyone in a similar situation before and can provide some insight/ advice?",2024-08-09 20:07:43,1,6,1,Positive,0.10261485826001956,0,0,2

1eq2x8q,careeradvice,Stuck in a City Job and am beginning to hate my current position. How to proceed forward?,"Hey guys. So, the title says it all. I’m literally seeking advice from any one of you career gurus out there who may have been in my shoes. So, I’ll start off with my background and a little bits of details for context here. 

I’m currently 30 (literally turning 31 near the end of this month btw) and have been in my City job for about a year and seven months now. I work in a call center environment and the job sucks. It’s stressful, demanding, and dead-end (I don’t wanna move up because I hate the job). But…it’s still a city job. It took me (7) years of being rejected before I finally got in. When I was half-way into this role, initially, I started applying voraciously for other roles within the City that I’d thought I’d be qualified for. And so far? I’ve only gotten one freaking interview. That’s it. And the end result was I got passed over for like (5) other people.

Anyways, I’m literally STILL trying to apply for other positions, but can’t get any callbacks for interviews since then. And it’s eating at me. I feel trapped. Stuck. Behind. Wasted potential. And dare I say…incompetent. I’m currently struggling to decide if I should stick it out until SOMETHING comes up for me or if I should look to work elsewhere. I really don’t want to leave the City. I’ve been weighing losing my pension, retirement, union membership, opportunities within the City, personal connections, and the various perks that it offers. I’ve been wracking my brain with this and it’s taking its toll. I’m just so goddamned tired of getting stuck in jobs where you can’t move up or go elsewhere internally. 

My resume isn’t too hot either. It just has warehouse and customer service backgrounds. I don’t have a degree (yet…I’m working on getting my Associates by the Summer of 2026), my experience isn’t really specialized or niche, and I’m entering into my early 30’s and the future looks like it could be wasted being stuck here in this job.

Any words of advice, guys? With the current job market/climate/environment, would it even be smart to even think of jumping ship from a City job? Even if it makes you miserable? Even if you feel that it’s the WRONG job for you to be in? A job that you HAVE to do to pay bills and survive? Should I stick it out? Is my resume and lack of education the sole reason for all of this? Are City jobs too big to run away from? So many questions. Any answers, feedback, criticism, comments, and advice is needed. I’m stuck and feel that I can’t make it out. 😔",2024-08-12 02:52:54,3,4,1,Negative,-0.09732142857142859,0,0,0

1erhhlo,college,Should I change the place where I’ll be doing my master’s degree?,"Long story short, I (23F) own a house and rent rooms to 4 other girls. The last three years have been really difficult as I had a lot to deal with emotionally but I managed to finish my bachelor’s degree with an honors mention and get a grant in the  research centre of the Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CrCHUM). While my studies, I’ve been doing burnout after burnout and  now it’s time that I change something in my life or otherwise, I will hit a wall at some point. I need advice because i’m not able to take a decision about what to do. So here I am, thinking about where I should be doing my masters: 

Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CrCHUM) 
Good: Well rated and well known as a research institute and I would be with a really good researcher which I could potentially publish in Nature with him. I got a grant there, which is super good for my CV. 
Not good: I would be traveling for 2h everyday to go and get back home so I would barely have time to train and have time for myself. This could be solved by taking an appartement in Montreal and renting my own room in my house but I love living with the 4 other girls. Also, most of my friends and all my life is in this city near Montreal. I know I wouldn’t have a lot of flexibility with my time there. I have already been doing my honor’s program there and ended up burned out because I had a lot to manage on the side.

Institut National de Recherche Scientifique (INRS)
Good: Is 15 min away by car from my house. I could also go by bike (Which I would absolutely love to). Would give me headspace to do something else than working and have time to train and do other things in my life as much as I want. I know I could find an excellent researcher to accept me in his lab. I get to stay with the girls in my house. 
Not good: I potentially (most probably) lose my grant but I will still be able to win 17 000$ instead of 27 000$ with the grant. This institute is potentially less good than the CrCHUM (I don’t know how to evaluate this?) 

This decision is killing me. I need help to consider everything. Let me know what you guys think of it. I’m afraid of how it will impact my studies in the future and need help in taking a decision. ",2024-08-13 19:55:30,3,2,1,Positive,0.19547619047619047,0,0,2

I love maths - hell, I had to, to survive 3 years here - the level of work is unbelievable. And I worked hard throughout the entire time here, my tutors and supervisors and the like have always said nice things about how hard I work. I can't say I haven't tried.

But now my exams are in two weeks, and I've been trying the past papers, and, I just. Can't. Do any of them. I'm able to half-do questions in certain topics I find ""nice"", for some things, like galois theory, I have no idea how to even begin on most of the questions. I don't know what went wrong, everything seemed ok until now with my worksheets and the like.

It's really getting me down because I'm worried I'll fail, or if I pass, I'll get a third. A 2.2 seems only possible by some combination of the examiners being generous, and a miracle. I'm really worried that I'll have ended up wasting my time here - all I did was study, I didn't do much fun stuff at uni or networking either, I'm a very socially awkward person, so I don't know what to do. I thought everything was going okay as I had a 2.1 in first year and a 2.2 just below a 2.1 in second year, and thought that with enough work I could get things up again this year (only the final year counts here)

1dqvw6d,stress,Sometimes in an automatic car press brake rather than accelerator or when I'm supposed to brake I press the accelerator,"
This happens occasionally when driving an automatic transmission car. 

There are two aspects to this. First, muscle memory which I believe is developed through repetition. 

Second is the mindset aspect as when I'm renting out an automatic car, there are thoughts at the back of mind that I'll press the wrong pedal and end up in an accident. I belive the fear and worry is a future projection that this will happen to me, which is an element of anxiety. 

What mindset hacks could I adapt o to ensure I press the right pedal everything I get into an automatic vehicle and improve my muscle memory?

P.S.. I don't know if driving a manual car affects this aspect.

Lets come to career choices I have:

1.I am not allowed and supported to take a drop year, even though I am confident about it that I can make it work since I know my wrongdoings now. Ps I can study for long hours. If you suggest this then I have to have a major fight against everyone.

2. I have some major interest in urban planning and want to do b arch or b planning .If you suggest this then you can tell me the scope, best way out and if I can do anything without actually joining the course, should i take a partial drop for nata , jee p2 AnB . My parents will accept this if I insist. But i can take it in the next year if i get a govt college. Reason is we are financially weak and I wish to do job after my ug degree to support them.Acc to my research job opportunities are less.

3. I am made to join a pvt bad Btech college(HIET GZB) which I can change to ABESIT GZB if I want.I have a minor interest in cs and coding. Should I forget my past and work in this?. I might prep for jobs then. Not rly interested in college,just for exposure n degree.
(If you want to suggest this then tell me which one to choose, Should I go for it or not, any insights about the future I can expect, scope)

I want to know if there's any way, method, anything that helps to control or reduce this tendency, if it's okay to refer at it like that? I never heard an actually good advice for anxiety or stress because it all reduces to ""just don't stress yourself so much, it's not that big of a deal"". And indeed, most of the times it's not a big deal, but I'm sick of hearing that because I genuinely can't help but feel anxious, even if it's something managable or fixable. I'm currently in therapy to get help with this and because I've picked my skin for a long time (probably caused by the stress). I'm not seeing much results yet because I've just started but I really would like to know if someone else had experienced something similar, have any advice, or maybe we could help each other. I just want to hear something constructive from someone with experience for once and that it's not going to invalidate how I feel.

1cg6o0h,stress,"Pain in gut, seeking motivation","Hey. I have pain in my gut when I get too stressed, it's not in the stomach it's in the bowel region.

I have problems with absorption, so I don't want to have food sitting in my bowel not getting digested properly when I'm stressed. But the problem is the fact that I choose to stress, even though it's not necessary right now for me in my situation. I suppose I'm having PTSD symptoms, my nervous system is overly active. So it's hard to relax. I wish I had the motivation to choose to relax and not get stressed over dumb things so in other words to have some self-empathy.

1cdgr5z,students,I can't act normal around my teacher,"I (15F) feel really weird around my A Math teacher. I'm fine in all the other lessons but in her lesson I feel super self conscious. I think I had a crush on her at one point of time after she helped me with a math problem where I almost cried because of how difficult it was. The weird part is, I'm not and have never been attracted to how she looks. The first lesson when she came into class, I didn't feel this way at all. I could act normally around her. 

But now in class I constantly try to avoid eye contact with her and I try to avoid asking her for help. I cried in a math recently because I was really stressed and my friend asked me if I was okay and the emotions kind of just burst. Afterwards she talked to me about why I cried and how to manage my stress. 

She's a really good teacher and person but I can't seem to act normal around her. Which is a problem because I struggle a lot with add math and having one part of my brain constantly think about how I seem to her affects how much I can concentrate on the qn. This doesn't happen with any other teachers, just her.

1e9tclx,university,Where do I go from here?,"Hi there, I just turned 18 about a month ago and am about to enter my 4th year of high-school. I've lived in North Macedonia (a non-EU Balkan country my whole life and was born here), I also have a Croatian (an EU country) citizenship since one of my parents is from and lives there.

I'm also becoming *increasingly* worried about what to do after I finish high-school. I know I would like to major in something like Management, Marketing or Tourism (I love traveling). If i go to university, I would like to study outside of North Macedonia. Definitely not in the US, but it would be nice if the uni i do end up going to has courses (or whatever they are called) in English since I'm decently proficient in it. I am open to learning new languages besides English, Macedonian and Croatian though.

There are plenty of things on my mind concerning university and the such.

**Some of them being**:

1. Which universities to apply to? And when?
2. Should I decide what country I'll study in right now so that I can learn the main language in the next year?
3. When do I search for scholarships (and how to find one that'll properly help me with funding, since my financial situation isn't be the best and I will need all the financial help I can get)?
4. Will I be able to work while studying and still get good grades?
5. Is it preferable to rent a place or use a dorm?

Many things about all this seem *so confusing* right now, and I don't really know where to really start looking. Am I rushing too much?

Thank you all for reading about my little (very) early life crisis \^\_\^

At this point, it’s taking a toll on my health. I am getting anxiety because of one of the jobs which also pays the least amount. 

I get tension pains in my neck and shoulder from the anxiety. I have become very blunt and direct with people as well. Basically an asshole. 

I’m 28, I have minor debt of $15,000.00. I have investment properties worth around $850K with $200- $400K equity.  I put them all up for sale.

If I sell all of the properties, I can drop down to 1 job and have a good nest reserve account and buy another investment property, have cash left over and hold down one of the jobs for income to cover my basic cost of living. 

At this point, if I can keep all 3 jobs, I’ll save $7K a month. If I can hold down the 3 jobs for 4-5 months I’ll change my life forever.

On the flip side, I am worried I’m killing my body.

In short; I have a brain condition, which has anxiety/stress like issues as one of its main symptoms. It's possible for me to get a surgery for it. But it's a very risky operation and it's also not a guarantee that it'll make everything go away.

I've been stuck with these symptoms for a few years now and I'm sick and tired of it and want to take action. I try to relax as much as I can and nothing in my life would be a big enough issue for me to cause me so much stress that my body is constantly failing me. 

Is there a way, perhaps through bloodwork or anything else to ensure that you're body is responding through actual stress instead of your brain being tricked into thinking it's stressed.

Putting this flair in case I am too detailed. I work a stressful job. I am also in debt and struggling to make ends meet so i picked a part time retail job as my second jobd. It doesn’t help that I have multiple psychiatric diagnosis including OCD, GAD, and PTSD. 

I am realizing that I have a big problem and I feel stuck which makes me feel even more defeated. I always knew i struggle with anxiety sure. My issue is the physical symptoms that have been just progressing pretty drastically and I am lying if a small part of me is not scared. Here are most of the symptoms currently:

- nausea
-gagging as if im gonna throw up hut obvi not eating much so its like dry throwing up???? Just awful 
-loss of appetite 
-poor sleep /nightmares/paranoia
-frequent panic attacks/ crying spells 
-sharp chest pain
- my resting pulse is averaging 110-130 ar highest
- fatigue and body aches
-dizziness and sometimes vertigo
- heartburn 
-the worst one personally: fevers. I wish i am joking. Like i literally will go through every symptom and have the chills and sweats etc. awful

Just the idea that i have to go to work tomorrow is causing me bad heartburn so im trying to chew tums as i write this. 

The problem is that i am not sure what to do? I am self supporting so i cant just quit and live with family ( i can only dream) but also im not exaggerating when i say i dont know how much i have it in me anymore. I have few days of PTO (3 days) that i plan to use  i just am wondering what is a more sustainable solution?

My life has been nothing but stress, probably since I was around 15 when my mom passed. From that day, I was on my own. That was the day I turned into an adult and had the weight of the world on my shoulders. And since then, it hasn’t let up. It’s been relentless and ever growing to the point it’s unbearable.

My stress is powerful. It consumes me. Every part of everyday is surrounded by stress. Even my “good days” are stressful. I could be driving, working, eating… hell, I could be just lounging around the house on my day off, but it’s there. It’s always there!!!

 What do I stress about???

Well… literally everything and anything. Bills, the weather, traffic, wife, kids, dogs, the food I burned on the stove, the chores and projects I have yet to do, work, a function coming up in 2 weeks… in essence, EVERYTHING.

This stress has destroyed me mentally, physically, emotionally… I do not even recognize the person I am today because of it. I’m less social, more irritable, and unable to enjoy just the simplest things in life. I couldn’t even begin to describe a “great day” if I had to. 

It’s made me physically ill all the time because of this, to the point of multiple ER trips over many years. Being referred to a cardiologist and GI doc, and countless psych meds that have done little to nothing.

I’m scared for my health and my future. 
I’m scared for my marriage and kids.

1en2ygu,careeradvice,Should I accept? - Enterprise Sales Exec. ,"Hello,

I am looking for some career advice from anyone willing to contribute...

I am unemployed, but not in urgent need for a job right away. My previous role was as a BDM for a SaaS; I have previous background in politics, where I worked for a Senator etc. and a Masters in International Relations. I then transitioned into Tech because of the flexibility, innovative and dynamic work environments compared to government.

I wore a lot of hats as a BDM -- I did outbound, marketing, and spearheaded some partnership initiatives.

I got energized by a webinar series I did on my own as well as the partnership project but also enjoyed a bit of the traditional sales. The company I worked for didn't really have their act together -- disorganized, no strategy, no marketing, software is not improving, pricey etc...it left me a bit scared to do another sales role...the pressure and lack of structure I had been poor on my mental health.

I have a job offer now for enterprise sales executive in an exciting field of tech - IoT/eSIM/telecommunications -- prospects here in this industry moving forward? I think it is a great role to refine my sales / account executive skills of course and learn. Likewise, I only have one year of BDM experience; I am a bit fearful...what if I can't close the deals ? But it seems this company has more of strategy/playbook/guidance etc...

I was more keen to go the partnerships' direction; since I'm more into the relationship-building long-term, co-marketing ideas, project collaboration; rather than aggressive close deal mind-set? But seems the two areas really overlap and maybe this role could propel me forward into a partnerships' role down the road or help discover more of the direction I should go?

I like creative, dynamic, and cross-functional projects. Unfortunately, I didn't ask about the potential to do this in the role, but it seems like there could be...(it 500 employee size, 40% growth yoy). The salary they offered seems low for base from my research, but I will counter negotiate...

I had a small interview today for Partnerships Manager but with this offer on the table...

1ddf7go,academia,"Academia, overwhelm, ?ADHD","How do you cope with overwhelm in academia? Would be grateful to hear about  tips or resources for managing the volume and variety of different tasks and activities. 

Like most academic staff, I always seem to have a lot on my plate. To a certain point, I accept that the job is demanding however...

My main problem is the effort that goes into grappling with the sheer quantity and variety of all the different tasks. I feel exhausted every day just trying to work through my to-do list to see what is essential and what I should work on first. 

I have been a project manager in a former life so I am pretty au fait with the idea of breaking tasks down, estimating effort, etc. But actually making progress in a systematc way with any of the projects rarely seems to happen, I just seem to bounce from one urgent task to another, or I'll start to get my to-do list back in order and just feel paralysed. 

Like a lot of people these days, I recognise myself in descriptions of some ADHD traits. It now feels hard to do the deep thinking required of research, and it was because I enjoyed that sort of deep focus work that I embarked on this career in the first place. I used to think of myself as an organised person, with good attention to detail. Now I am prone to feeling like I'm a mess most the time, often missing deadlines, never seem to be able to find any of the information I need in my overflowing inbox, and missing important details frequently.

1eiwshk,careeradvice,Burned out with managing people,"I’m in tech, I lead tech engineers, i’m part of leadership and have a voice with decision making. Aside from being a leader, I also handle quarterly projects, scripting, managing some of our core applications, these things excite me the most.

Lately, dealing with my team members stressed me a lot, I always wanted to check my email even on weekends to make sure my team members didn’t screw up or something, I feel like im being condescending to them sometimes when answering them because of stress or i just don’t want to deal with them.

I got burned out to the point where I looked for another job like engineering position, I really like the company and the job, if we meet with compensation I might accept it.

Anyone here with the same dilemma where you no longer want to be the boss/manager and just like to be an engineer or a tech solving problems? Would transitioning from manager back to tech will damage my career path?

I’m currently 21 years old and I’m a community college student in New England. I’m currently enrolled in an engineering program that will allow me to transfer to a 4 year. I also work at an internship part-time at an engineering firm. But the thing is, I’m not enjoying it anymore. Last semester I was just so depressed from always studying when I got home for hours into the next morning only to barely pass my classes. There were even times when I didn’t have time to sleep and shower (I know, it’s gross) let alone see friends and family. I’ve taken the summer break to readjust my life (workout and exercise more, eat healthier, and trying to reverse this depression with professional help) but I don’t want to go back to school for engineering. Don’t get me wrong, I still want to get a degree, but I feel aimless and I don’t know where to go. Engineering is something I thought I wanted for myself, but after working at my internship, I’ve realized that I don’t want to be at a desk all day doing calculations. Im at a point where I have all my gen eds, minus a class or two, so I can start any other major as at least a sophomore and take the core program classes but I’m stuck on what to choose. I’d stay in engineering because I’ve sunk two years into it but I just can’t handle the stress and depression that came with it. I’ve looked into everything from construction management, to business, to electronic technology. I have a little interest in everything and unfortunately I tend to loose interest in what I do sometimes. Currently, I’m looking into Criminal Justice and a minor in psychology. I’ve always loved the idea of helping and being a part of my community and being a cop seems really cool (I know it’s not a requirement to have a degree to be a cop but I’ve heard that it helps to raise the ranks easier and get a better salary). I also don’t want to be rich, just to make enough where I’m not worrying about money all the time and have the possibility to make more and support a family in the future. I also want to possibly be a political figure in the future (like city council, mayor, governor, senator, rep, or even president?) to further help the community I grew up in. I’m scared that I burned myself out and that I lost my ability to like learning but I hear CJ is an easy major that teaches you a lot about how our society works under law and I feel like that understanding will be very beneficial to my goals. I’d love some advice from people who have graduated from this major or who have had this “aimless feeling”. Thanks in advance! ",2024-07-01 17:25:01,4,5,1,Positive,0.055645904483113774,0,0,2
1es7dae,college,Do i quit my college job?,"I am currently a senior in college. I have spent the whole summer trying to debate whether or not I wanted to quit one of my on campus jobs or not, and I still don't have an answer. For some context: I have a 3.5 gpa, I have two other jobs and one extracurricular (6 hours a week), I been with this job for about 3 years, and it makes me work about 20 hours a week.

Pros to quitting: Simply put, it makes me feel incredibly unhappy. Every time I think about it, I feel anxious and my heart starts racing. While I had a good experience at the beginning, I really can't imagine putting myself through another year with it because just the thought of it is so miserable. Quitting would give me free time to explore other interests and potentially nag some internships. I had so much burnout and a hit to my self confidence, that I barely did anything this summer, and I still don't know if I feel mentally prepared for college.

Cons to quitting: I have been with this job since my freshman year. If I quit, I am losing a social circle and connection with some friends that I have known since the beginning of college. I also lose about 150 a week. I already have two other jobs on campus, but they have less hours don't pay nearly as much. And besides the financial loss, I already feel so much imposter syndrome compared to my peers, some of whom are working 5 jobs, while I will only be working two slightly lower commitment jobs. I also worry that it puts me at a disadvantage for grad school since I didn't have a summer research opportunity or internship this summer, and it was already such a significant time commitment and a good resume booster.",2024-08-14 17:19:28,1,11,1,Positive,0.018518518518518514,0,0,2

First of all I would like to apologize if I use wrong terminology and if this question isn't meant for this sub.

I'm a university student and my situation is that whenever I'm in class, during exams, conducting interviews, presenting presentations, whenever a teacher even adresses me or looks in my direction, if someone says a word that rhymes with my name and I think they are calling for me, I get anxiety, fear and stress (and my stomach/abdomen hurt/cramp and force me to go to the bathroom) 

I went to the pharmacy today and asked if there is any over the counter medicine to help and they recommended me to take Magnesium and Vitamin B12 as it helps calm the nerves, an assistant there said they pretty much live on magnesium in a joking way, and an older customer said that magnesium is good and his son takes it and was good for him,

They presented me with ""relaxium"" ""neovimag"" and ""manef""

as such, i find myself doing research in two labs (one of which is such a toxic environment i have nightmares about going in but i’m sort of stuck there due to LOR and other reasons), but not having any internships or significant publications (really any standout factors that i feel would get me in to a top program). i have these big dreams of attending a top PhD program, but i’ve come to realize that my profile is somewhat mediocre. as such, it feels like the entirety of my career rests on a knife’s edge and there’s nothing more for me to do to bolster my application in the next 6 months, so all i can do is sit back and watch. i don’t think i’m going to get in to a top program, and i’m crushed.

i’m overwhelmed by the immensity of bullshit departmental politics and put out by a total lack of engagement from my peers in many of my classes. i watched the really motivated and positive grad student i started studying under slowly fall victim to burnout and become a shell of their former self. i had two really exciting internship opportunities that fell flat at the last minute due to funding. everything feels pointless honestly. i’m beyond burned out. the academic machine has claimed another victim and brother im only in my fourth year

1enh4dg,careeradvice,How to tell manager you're resigning ,"I'm a social worker. I spent a year on frontline and knew it wasn't for me, but I had to remain with the company to avoid having to repay the relocation allowance they gave me. I moved over to another team which I thought was going to be better, but after 5 months I have had enough. My team is great and I really enjoy the work, but the case load is way too high. I'm working overtime and struggling to keep up with all the demands. I have tried to raise this with my manager and who has been supportive, but there is no prospect of hiring new members in our team to lessen the load. It's been impacting my mental health to the point where I have decided I'm willing to repay the relocation package to have a better work-life balance.

The thing is, when I joined this team, they were letting go of agency workers in a push to secure permanent workers for the benefit of the children we serve. The goal was for the children to have continuity in their social worker and I had every intention to be in this for the long haul. I've made great relationships with the kids - some have even said I'm the best they've had. By the end of my notice period, I would have only been in the role for 9 months. So what I am really bummed about is letting the team and the kids down. I feel a lot of guilt. 

I've been offered a job at another company that I'm excited about but don't know how to break the news to my manager who has been good to me, given the circumstances. I keep reflecting on my interview, where I talked about wanting to give continuity to the children and being on board with the initiative. It feels like I'm such a hypocrite, but the case load is way above what I was told it would be and I am crippled by the stress so I know it's the right decision.

1cw5pnz,stress,Feeling Overwhelmed and Depressed – Need Advice,"Hey everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. I'm writing this because I don't really know where else to turn, and I’m feeling pretty desperate for some advice and support.

Lately, I've been feeling incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out. It seems like no matter what I do, I can’t shake this constant feeling of anxiety and depression. I've been struggling to keep up with my responsibilities, both at work and in my personal life, and it’s all starting to take a serious toll on my mental health.

To give some context, I'm balancing multiple demanding projects at work while also trying to find a new job. The pressure to succeed is immense, and I'm constantly worried about failing or not being good enough. My perfectionism only makes things worse, as I often feel like I need to excel in everything I do.

On top of all this, I’m trying to learn new skills and grow professionally, which adds another layer of stress. It feels like there’s always something more to do and never enough time to do it. The weight of all these responsibilities is just so heavy.

I don’t have many people to talk to about how I’m feeling. It’s hard to open up about just how much I’m struggling right now. I'm finding it hard to sleep, my appetite is all over the place, and I feel like I'm on the verge of a breakdown. I try to take breaks and practice self-care, but it never feels like enough. The feelings of hopelessness are overwhelming.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope with the overwhelming stress and feelings of depression? Are there any techniques or strategies that helped you find some balance and peace? I would really appreciate any advice or words of encouragement.

This position is within the realm of what I’d like to do for my career, but with a different team.

Instead of tossing me to the side, they recommended me to a different team and I ended up getting this position instead. I was very lost because this team is new and my position is brand new. I decided to ride it out since it was the only position I heard back from and I needed a job really bad. The pay is good and the team is good, but I feel so unhappy. I have no clue what my actual job is, it kind of feels like tasks get tossed to me at random if someone else’s workload is too much for them… but then I’m also expected to kind of keep busy? I think my anxiety has just been through the roof because of that. 

Now, I was hired through a recruiting agency and this is the same one that gave me my first job when I graduated. I like to think I have a great relationship with them, but I know how much recruiters need their candidates to stay for the full term. I don’t want to burn a bridge with them, but I also don’t think I can last the rest of my term here. My friends are saying I should start applying for jobs and reach out to my recruiter, but I don’t know how they’ll react? I’m just so lost. 

If I’m ready to get out of my position and move on to a new job, should I communicate that with my recruiter first before applying? Or should I apply, wait to hear back and then speak with my recruiter when I know I have something locked in?

1cy0akj,stress,Things I love are overwhelming,"This is more of a question to see if anyone else feels the same way. 

Do you ever love something so much that you begin to feel stressed? 

Example One. Video games, I play a video game and I’ll be so devoted to it. However, when I get burnout and take a little break it’s almost impossible to play it again/finish it even though I really want to! I think the fact it is going to end is stressful and to avoid it ending I avoid it entirely. I just want it to be perfect. 

The same with TV shows, I’ll really enjoy a tv show but if I’m busy and stop watching for a few days it feels so overwhelming to start again, I feel physically stressed to think about watching it even thought I really want to watch it! Sometimes I’ll just avoid the last episode of TV shows all together. 

This isn’t a major problem in my life but I do feel anxiety and stress when I think about stuff like this so whilst kind of trivial I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this? ",2024-05-22 13:30:44,3,2,1,Positive,0.20471014492753625,0,0,2
1el0zsu,careeradvice,I feel like I’m a bad engineer ,"I (23F) graduated college about a month more than a year ago. So it’s been about one year and a month since I started working at my big WiFi software company with a computer engineering degree as a developer. I have fixed some bugs as needed, stepped up and took over all the work from the people who were laid off to automate test results, and am working on a certification and some other bigger projects. However I have been spending around 2 months on these two projects and they are still not finished. I just feel so stupid and lazy for the fact that things are taking so long. My team has been there for many years and are so talented. I was wondering is this normal to feel this way? As if you are slow moving and aren’t able to figure things out as easily? My manager was super happy with my work when I took over the people who got laid off’s test cases bc I fulfilled a necessity and brought in testing to our development team. But now the higher ups seem disappointed. They didn’t say much of anything, just asked that some questions like ‘when will this be done’ ‘we need you on this’ and I feel overwhelmed and like I am disappointing a lot of people.
To top it all off I’m going to UCLA in 2 months for my graduate degree bc I’m fucking tired of this and stupid so I accepted their offer and I think more education can’t hurt. I don’t know I feel exhausted and dumb. I know I’m leaving anyway and shouldn’t care but I can’t shake the thought that I’ll never get another job after my one year of grad school (ucla has a one year program) because I’m dumb ",2024-08-05 22:20:21,3,3,1,Negative,-0.016369047619047606,0,0,0
1enhrtd,careeradvice,Job decision/rejection... Anxiety or gut feeling,"Sorry it's a long one...
I'd been in my role almost 3 years and was applying for jobs because I was getting a bit bored. When I finally got offered one deciding whether to take it or not caused a lot of anxiety (decision paralysis!!!) I had reservations but speaking to family they encouraged me to go for it. Well I went for it,.started new job and it was a disaster. From day 1 I knew it was a mistake and for 3 months of working there I had severe anxiety and panic attacks. I was very close to leaving with no job due to the impact it was having on me, but was fortunate that my old place offered my role back. I've recently returned but have also been offered a new job elsewhere (from interviewing before I knew I'd be returning). It's a 10k pay increase, slighty more hours, no sick pay, other benefits crap but has the possibility of learning and development.
I've been having constant anxiety about making the decision because something doesn't feel right. I don't know if it is anxiety or gut feeling. 
My current job is very flexible, in summary I cram most of my job in 3 days and the other 2 are very chill and lots of freedom to attend appointments/ fit around kids etc. 

A little about me.. I am suffering depression and having been plodding along for a while but the recent job that went wrong exaggerated everything much more, especially anxiety, and it's been crippling. I am awaiting therapy. I think one reason I was looking for another job was hoping that it might lift my mood or give me some confidence. Part of me is struggling to engage and the smallest stressor is like the end of the world. so learning a new job I I'm concerned I won't be able to handle the stress and will crash and burn. 

So do I play safe and stay where i am, get myself in a better place and take advantage of the work life balance. Or take another risk? 

I do know that I will want to move from my current role but not sure if the timing is right, also hoping I'd find a job that I feel positive about the move.

If I make the move and it doesn't work out, I obviously will have burned the bridge with my old/current employer and we all know how terrible the job market is at the moment!! 

Just looking for some opinions. At the moment I'm thinking reject the offer and find a role I feel better about, even if it doesn't have the same pay increase.

1e4ynkf,university,Should I drop my class???,"Hi guys,

So I just finished my Biochem exam today it was worth 40% of my grade and I feel so discouraged because of it. This is a summer course so its really tight packed and fast paced, we covered up to 5 units of material within two weeks of beginning the class and we just had the exam, so things have happened quite quickly. Anyways I made up to 50 pages of notes on this exam, did all the practice quizes, studied every single day, hours a day for more than a week. Once I got to the exam all the questions were not what I studied, it was so complex and it felt like I hadn't learned any of that material, like I felt blindsided. Alot of the questions I guessed completely or just bs the whole thing, because I genuinely didn't know it. I feel so upset and mad at myself right now. Im so stressed that I just got home from the exam and I am already studying for the next exam, but I don't know if I should just drop the class at this point.

**The weight of the tests in the class are worth:**

**exam 1 (i just did it today) - 40%**

**exam 2 - 40%**

**weekly quizzes - 20%**

The last day to drop is in 6 days but if I drop the class, a voluntary withdrawl or ""VW"" will show up on my transcript (wont effect GPA, but the professional schools I apply for this might effect their decision). This class grade will show up for when I try and apply for dental school, and if I did bad on this exam my whole class grade is bad and then I wont be competitive enough for the dental schools. What should I do? drop the class and get a ""VW"" on my transcript and take the class later on, or stay in the class and likely get a barley decent mark???

Thanks!!!",2024-07-16 20:15:41,3,7,1,Positive,0.03755580357142859,0,0,2
1el2ein,careeradvice,My job is trying not to pay me,"So I have been working at a pub as an Assistant General Manager for 9 months. When I was hired the idea was that I would get a raise from 37.000 to 40.000 and potentially become the GM of this pub after my probation (That would have been a massive underpayment so I stayed at AGM and didn't want all of the responsibility). The GM that worked before I joined got sacked so me and another AGM were running the pub. Up until January we didn't have any kind of support and I wasn't getting a lot of training to eventually become GM.

The Problem: I stupidly never really got any of this formally in writing (I know, absolute idiot) the only thing I have in writing so far is one sentence in a short meeting In February: """"boss"" to finalise pay increase (passed probation)."" I'm still trying to see if I can find any other paper trail of my pay increase.

I calculated how much money they owed me since Feb: £1215 (which isn't a lot for this company as they have multiple pubs that are doing well) And I also know that the bar manager (my subordinate) that was hired to support me is earning the same as me and has half of the responsibilities that I have.

They initially told me that I had to improve certain areas to get the raise recently when I brought the conversation back up. I said that isn't true and sent them a screenshot of the meeting notes as mentioned before. In between all of this I have handed in my notice as I'm moving back home. HR got involved as well and they have now said that the raise was never fully confirmed so they can't pay me, they have however offered me a bonus of £500 as a thanks for all my work (yuck). 

I would like to go to court as I feel like they have fucked me over royally as I would have left months ago had they said this before. Does anyone think I have a chance? 

I have been in good standing with everyone in the company and have done a lot for them. I feel this is such a kick in the face after all the grey hairs I have sprouted because of this job. I haven't always been perfect with timings and deadlines but this was also due to the fact that I was running the pub on my own for an extended period of time without being fully trained on everything. Multiple people (including some people that have told me I'm not getting the raise) have said that I was left alone without any support for too long.

1avkrwe,stress,Underlying stress and how to deal with it,"Hey there,  
  
So, ever since I was a kid, my hands have always been shaky. I just figured it was a normal thing for me. Every time I went to the doctor about it, they'd give me some vitamins, mostly vitamin D because, you know, Norway doesn't exactly have sunlight in abundance. But none of that seemed to help.  
  
Then, when I was about 16, I started having trouble breathing. The docs thought it was asthma and gave me an inhaler, which kinda worked for a bit. But lately, life's been throwing a lot at me. Long story short, I found someone I really care about, but my parents totally disapprove. Cue endless arguments, roadblocks, threats, and even some physical stuff. And now, on top of everything, I'm getting what seem like panic attacks. My head feels tight, my hands shake even worse, and I can barely catch my breath.  
  
When I finally went back to the doc about it, she just said it's probably stress. Makes sense given everything that's going on, but weirdly, I don't really feel all that stressed out. Still, therapy seems like a good idea. Problem is, it's expensive, and my student budget isn't exactly on board with that. I'm hoping I can find some help at the university, where it's free. But until then, I guess I'll just have to tough it out.

","hello! i am living off campus this year and will be sharing a house. i've been thinking of getting a mini fridge as my other roommates are from culinary backgrounds and have strict fridge etiquette i don't think i will be able to keep up with (ex labelling + dating all items). also, i do keep some items after the expiry date (obviously nothing spoiled or over a week, but a couple days leniency), and they said that's going to be a no go for them. as well, after reading too many roommate horror stories, i am slightly paranoid of my roommates taking my food/drinks, but feel like it's a bit rude to keep lockable fridge boxes right off the bat. because of that i've been thinking of keeping my own mini fridge in my room, but are a couple things im worried about!

one complaint is that they are very energy intensive. we split utilities and i don't want to raise the electricity bill for all of us because of a personal decision. for those who pay utilities, how has a minifridge been cost wise? 

  
next is the temperature. i need the fridge to be able to reach a food safe temperature because i plan to keep food in it, rather than just a drink/skincare cooler like many mini fridges are (or anything that needs an ice pack to stay cold). unfortunately anything i find that seems to be a proper, cold fridge is either too large or energy intensive. 

noise is also a worry i have, but honestly anything quieter than a fan should be manageable.

The problem is that I don't know how to balance work and rest, so I end up working too much and bottling up my emotions and stress. I'm aware of this, but it doesn't seem like too much of a bad thing because at least I'm being productive, and all I care about now is getting the desired results. 

Anyhow, today is one of those bad days. I woke up early to study, like always, and since yesterday wasn't the most productive day ever because I had to go out for a few hours, I decided to go hard this morning. My body didn't agree I guess, so after half an hour of studying my hands started shaking, my breath was erratic, I started sobbing and I couldn't focus. 
Obviously I took this as a sign of a needed break, but it's honestly kind of ridiculous. Why do I get these overwhelming stressful feelings, even after a day of relaxation and a very short lived studying session? I have everything planned, I'm doing everything like I'm supposed to do, but I can't help but sometimes get these waves of stress that wash over me. 

I'm starting to feel like I'm not smart enough to pass these stupid exams, and since my future depends on these results I don't know what else to do but to study very hard. But sometimes I just can't, and it feels like I'm wasting precious time. 
Of course I take a few hours to rest and reset after a long day, so I don't know what I'm doing wrong. This is just so important to me I can't not stress about it. 
This morning is already wasted, and I feel like a failure.
 This week was mostly slow as well, I really need to pick up the pace, but this overwhelming stress of the approaching exams isn't helping. 
Not sure what I'm expecting the replies to be, but getting it off my chest is somewhat therapeutic. ",2024-04-21 09:07:51,1,3,1,Negative,-0.004019756838905763,0,0,0
1ec48r6,stress,Stressing about Next Year Living Situation and Job,"I am a student currently, thankfully I have amazing parents who have paid for my schooling and living situation. I graduate next year, and as soon as I am done school I am on my own. My parents have helped immensely so it makes sense to be on my own. 

I don’t have a problem with it, but where I live currently is expensive. $900 a month with another roommate (my partner). It doesn’t make sense to move in with my parents as they live in a very small town with little to no opportunity. Of course I want a job, but it’s hard to find a job where I am currently. I am reaching out to professors and etc, like I have been for sometime to try and get myself a job after graduation. 

I have begun to stress about a new thing, I stress so much about even tiny things. It eats me alive, I will be vomiting and feel like I am on deaths bed with illness because of how much stress impacts me. Yes I try coping things, but beyond this I just don’t know what to do. 

Maybe I just want a lending hand on tips in finding a job, networking, etc. I will be staying in the same area I am in now, and just need a job lined up for after graduation and then I will be fine. It’s just the stress of maybe not getting a job in time. 

I hope this is all understanding, and I hope people can respond back with messages that won’t stress me additionally as I am already stressed sick and throwing up from all this stress even though the future is really out of my control right now.",2024-07-25 19:53:23,2,4,1,Positive,0.061269980019980026,0,0,2
1eqqcat,college,Was the advisor right? (Undeclared and majors),"I’m going to be a freshmen this 26th. I wanted to change my schedule so I was talking to an advisor to see what I could do. I’m currently on the “undeclared to pre-nursing” route my college offers. 

Also it’s a state college and before anyone starts bashing me on why I didn’t go to community college, the grants I received for the state college was more than the cc. So Im getting more disbursed back.

Back to what I’m meant to talk about, I’ve been uncertain with what I want to pursue as a career. I’m looking for something lucrative since I come from a poor family, therefore I want to do somthing in STEM. 

I was hoping to volunteer at a hospital first semester and see if I like being a nurse before I fully dive deep into continuing that pathway yet my advisor told me that’s impossible. You don’t know if you want to be a nurse until you start the science classes and are in the nursing program. This kinda stumped me since this entire time, I’ve been thinking, it’s okay, I can change my major if I end up realizing I don’t like nurisng and even though it might be stressful to catch up, it’s possible. All I have to do is figure out if I truly want to be a nurse. Now I feel worried since my other option was engineering, I not sure which type of engineering, but that was the other plan. 

All of this has been stressed out now. 
Any advice? Was the advisor right?

1cyagjx,university,Pace VS The New School (Very anxious & I need some guidance/help picking one!!),"Hello. I’m conflicted. I’ve wanted to go to school in NYC. Specifically Art School & now I’ve finally been accepted to a few schools. Now the hard part is making a decision & actually picking one. 

-I was accepted to SVA. I was accepted 2 years ago too. The curriculum seems expansive, but the tuition is 80k+, the financial aid is ASS & they don’t even have a dining hall. I never truly wanted to go there anyway. So, I'm not going there. It’s decided. Plus it’s for-profit…ew. (I know all colleges for profit but this one is REALLY for-profit) 

-A week ago, I was accepted to Pace with a 22k scholarship (even with the scholarship it’s still expensive, 58k left over to pay out of pocket.) Very grateful for the scholarship. I sent in the deposit using money I did not have just to hold my fucking spot. 

-I was just accepted to The New School today. I didn’t want to get my hopes up & didn’t. But I was pleasantly & painfully surprised this morning. Pleasantly, because it was one of the top schools on my list…I was proud of myself for actually getting in. Painfully, because I know the tuition is going to pound my ass. I don’t come from money. I don’t come from anything at all. I’m from a low income family. Haven’t gotten to see the financial aid package yet. But I know I wasn’t offered a scholarship like Pace. I applied for Parsons, & was rejected, but was given admission to Eugene Lang. If I end up going with The New School, I’ll be choosing the Visual Arts concentration. 
I’ve always wanted to go to Art School. I like unorthodox, hands on/project based, non-traditional & weird curriculum. I like hands-on work. I don’t wanna do boring fucking generic Math class. I want to dive headfirst into what I came for. Studying & creating art!

I’ll be living on campus & I'm worried about navigating that. This is my first time away from home & I’m not sure about literally anything. Still trying to remain strong in spite of. 

Also, I'm an out of state student from Michigan who’s low income, with a single parent & an EFC of $0. Fun!


I guess my main questions for Pace are:

-Why do people hate Pace? Went on tik tok & everyone hates it apparently… :/

-How are the classes & facilities for BFA Photography/Art students? Are these facilities worth the price tag?

-Are there gluten free dining options? (I’m not gluten free by choice, it makes me ill. not celiac.) Is the food decent?

-Is what Pace gives you worth it for the price? 
-How are the dorms? I’m eyeing 33 Beekman & 15 Beekman.

-Are there communal cooking spaces? 

-How hard is it to get a single room? I ask this as someone who’s covid conscious & getting sick is not an option. I simply can’t afford to! 

-How hard is it to make friends? I'm pretty worried about this. I don’t know anyone in nyc yet. 

-if you’re an alumnus, do you feel that you got out  everything you could from the school/experience? Do you regret it? What were the best parts? How’s your career now & what do you do? 

-What are the pros & cons of Pace? The good, the bad & the ugly. Hit me. 



Main Questions for the The New School: 

- How’s the financial aid for need based? Does it help at all? Does TNS even care about giving decent aid?

-Why do people hate The New School? I’ve seen multiple videos of everyone also hating it.

-How are the classes & facilities for Eugene/Visual Art students? Are the facilities worth the price tag? 

-Are there gluten free dining options? Is the food decent?

-Is what TNS gives you worth it for the price? 

-How are the dorms? (please dear god don’t say flooding…) I’m eyeing Kerrey & Stuyvesant. 

-Are there communal cooking spaces?

-How hard is it to get a single room? I ask this as someone who’s covid conscious & getting sick is not an option. I simply can’t afford to! 

-How hard is it to make friends? I'm pretty worried about this. I don’t know anyone in nyc yet. 

-Is everyone out of touch with reality & extremely rich like it seems? 😵‍💫

-What are the pros & cons of TNS? The good, the bad & the ugly. Hit me. 

-if you’re an alumnus, do you feel that you got out  everything you could from the school/experience? Do you regret it? What were the best parts? How’s your career now & what do you do?

I’m very conflicted looking for guidance on which one to pick. Trying to make a final decision by the beginning of next week. 

Thank you in advance. :)

1el794k,careeradvice,In need of advice,"Currently working for a small financial services company (think “we’re a family here”) 5 minutes from my house & super flexible on time off / personal freedom, for $25/HR flat no benefits, felt mislead during the interview process with promise of “$10,000-$50,000” bonuses which have yet to materialize, additionally I feel stagnant in my role and dread going in every morning, however the culture is extremely laid back and the flexibility is unmatched, my role is operational by nature and not customer facing 

Recently I have been recruited for a BD position with a major company (have not received an offer as of yet) who values my industry knowledge and will be going for my final round of interviews soon , would be a considerable pay bump (expecting 50-100% increase in pay) with healthcare, 401k match & profit share… but commute would be 30-45 minutes and super corporate atmosphere with little flexibility, 

This is a no brainer right? If I get an offer I should take it? Really worried about the effect the commute would have on my quality of life, but I think I would be absolutely mad to turn it down 

Edit: thought I should add, my wife has recently started  her own company, the income of which will out-shadow anything I am able to produce W2, so comp is not a huge concern… is the stagnant feeling a sign I should jump ship? Is the fact I’m feeling froggy and taking interviews a good sign it’s time for me to move on? ",2024-08-06 03:09:28,2,1,1,Positive,0.05387301587301586,0,0,2

1dcb3zn,academia,Advice Needed on Sensitive Issue,"Hi Everybody,

I am posting this from a throwaway account. I wanted to ask people their opinion on a sensitive question, and if I am overreacting. This will also be very long, and sound insane (because it is), so I will put a tl;dr at the end. I recently finished up my MA in a humanities field at a US institution. I did very well professionally, but socially/politically the experience was a disaster. I was sexually harrassed, and also experienced what I have heard called colloquially as ""mobbing"" because other graduate students as well as faculty viewed me as a ""superstar."" Their words, never mine.

I moved across the country to do my MA, and did not know anyone at the school. Did not meet with anyone before hand. Just showed up. It was a disaster from the start. On the first day of the program (orientation), one professor made an idle side remark that he thought I was ""really smart."" Not meant to be heard, but it was loud enough that I, in the back of the classroom, heard it, and I realized soon that other students had as well. This was obvious because, the day after, we all met up to get to know each other, and one guy was very obviously trying to talk down to me. I realized very early on that I was in a bad situation and set out to keep this person at arm's length. I also realized very early on that the guy who tried to talk down to me, as well as a woman in the cohort, were attracted to me. Easy to tell by the way they looked at me as well as some initial idle flirting. I tried to be polite but also tried to give off what I thought were subtle but nevertheless clear signals that I was not interested.

For the first couple of weeks, I tried to ingratiate myself into the department as best I could while still assessing the situation/trying to not rock the boat. Still more flirting, still more competition over grades. This same guy would constantly text me asking what grades I was getting in our cohort's class; he tried to be nonchalant but it was extremely obvious what he was doing. The woman in our cohort was still being flirty. Then came the *fun.* This guy started going around to other people in the cohort behind my back, telling people that I was lying about various parts of my life, which I was not. To make a long story short, I realized that, while being jealous of my reputation of being ""smart,"" he was also growing jealous of the attention I was getting from this woman. And was still attracted to me.

Anyway, things kept going and I kept feigning interest in this woman and trying to get the guy to get the fuck off my case. Things went from idle flirting to her insinuating that she would like to have sex with my mom (who she did not know nor had seen, not that it matters), and well as rope me into a threesome. And the guy kept trying to put me down, making remarks such as ""I don't listen to anything you say."" Which I knew was not true, but at any rate felt revealed his character.

Things went on like this for most of the first semester, and these two charmers actually started dating. I figured this was to my advantage, maybe they'd leave me alone. Wrong. To make another long story short, they tried to initiate a threesome with me. I politely told them to fuck off. Also, I heard them discussing with each other, right before a class was set to begin, how ""hot"" they thought I was (they thought I was out of earshot).

I had not told anyone in the department, faculty or other grad student, about my actual feelings. I did not trust any of them. The guy leading this charge was close friends with a very popular, influential professor. I felt, possibly incorrectly but who knows, that, being new in town, I would not be believed.

At the end of the first semester, I lost patience, and finally blew up at one of them, telling them exactly, in colorful language, what I thought of them. I'm not proud of it, but I was fed up, and that effectively ended all contact between me and the other students. None of this had reached any of the faculty.

I kept to myself during the second semester, which I was fine with, and was doing very well with my classes and research. But still, I heard this guy going after me behind my back. Once, I heard him remark (again, thinking I could not hear) that he had ""put me in my place."" I noted it, and did not say anything.

Cut to summer break. I had just finished with research, things are going well. I get called into meet with the department chair and DGS. They had heard about my blowup and wanted to hear my side of the story. The woman had construed me as jealous that I was not dating her. I laid out, in careful detail with verbatim quotes, as I am doing here, what the actual situation was. They nodded along and, to my surprise, actually took me pretty seriously.

Except one of them - this was the professor close with the guy in the story. I told them that I was extremely uncomfortable being around them for obvious reasons. This guy responded with something I will never forget or forgive. When I said ""I am very uncomfortable around these two,"" he responded: ""Why don't you just show them that you're not uncomfortable?""

I did not confront him, and the meeting otherwise ended agreeably - I got moved to a private space and we agreed that no contact would be best. The next two semesters were largely without incident (one other student, not one of the two mentioned, started stalking me, but that's a story for another day). I finished up, graduated, and am set to publish some of my work (!), and am already much happier being out of that environment.

Now for the actual advice part. I am convinced that the guy in this story is just a flat-out narcissist, just an awful person. Aside from my many problems with him, I had undergrad students (who had no clue about my situation) complain to me that he would talk down to/yell at students for no reason. The woman in this story also had some narcissistic traits, in my view. I got out largely unscathed (concerning mental health) because I was able to, in a manner of speaking, see the chess moves before they were made - I knew that I, outside of my outburst, had done very little wrong.

I am more concerned about people who will encounter these two in the future. Both are going on to PhD programs, different schools. I understand that there is plenty of narcissism in academia, but this seemed extreme even in that context. But I am worried for the talented student who may encounter either of them and not have the benefit that I had.

I am considering writing to the heads of the departments they are enrolling in to warn them about their behavior. Something to the effect of ""don't revoke enrollment, but put out the word to your students."" I genuinely feel that it could make a difference to somebody, somewhere - I would have a hard time believing that this kind of behavior would suddenly never resurface.

First: if you are a faculty member with grad students, would you welcome this kind of letter? Would you take it seriously and take it under advisement? Would you want to be aware of this kind of behavior?

Second: Do you think a warning letter is even a good idea? I have no plans to continue in academia, so I am not worried about repercussions and am more than happy to put my name on the letters I would send. But even then, part of me feels that it might be a step too far. I just don't know.

Anyway, if you actually read all of that, thanks. Any advice would be welcome, especially if you have been in a comparable situation.

**TL;DR: I was sexually/academically harassed by/put up with extremely narcissistic behavior from colleagues. They are going on to PhD programs. Should I reach out to their departments to warn them?**",2024-06-10 02:36:53,0,8,1,Positive,0.08171890389152293,0,0,2

At work, our team leader took us for coffee to cafe which is in our workplace. We sat down with drinks and I had trouble with drinking it, I was stressed to pick up a mug in front of my colleagues, somehow I was afraid of it and when I took first sip it was very awkward, I don’t even know how to describe it but my move was unnatural and sudden because of stress of (I don’t know) maybe spilling or that that someone just looking at me? My hands were shaking when I wanted to pick up mug but during whole situation I was normally talking and laughing but somehow my body was uncontrollable.  
I mean, I eat everyday with them, even in larger groups (with other teams) and I don’t have those type of problems - sometimes maybe talking in those kind of groups when a lot of people listen then maybe my tongue is crying a little but I don’t shake and etc.  
Few days ago this happened again but during the dinner at cantina. I couldn’t pick up a fork because my hand was shaking, even picking pizza with hand was hard - again my body was uncontrollable.  I ended up taking up pizza and eating it while going back to work with colleagues. Like I mentioned earlier previous situation didn’t happen during lunch/dinner time but suddenly it did and I can’t think of a reason.   
Now I’m little afraid that it will happen again and I will make it more difficult because of stressing that it will happen and thinking of previous times.

I'm pretty new to the interior design industry, and for a while I was looking for a job that would pay the bills while I hone my skills and experience to become a designer. But this interview with a showroom made me rethink my plans (great hours and pay, good environment, fair employers, job security, product I can see myself becoming passionate about, etc.). The interview went really well and they offered to let me come shadow for a few days to make sure the fit is good, said they were letting all candidates know if they had moved on without them, etc. 

I emailed a week or so later asking politely for a progress update because I had gotten another offer but the showroom position was my priority. They said they were taking their time but wished me the best. I said I was going ahead with the other opportunity but would love to keep the door open and remain under consideration for this role (I was worried this would be a red flag but my friends were like ""You have bills to pay and people should understand that""). They thanked me. That was a month ago.

The other job didn't work out (pay was terrible and I hated it lol. took it because I was panicking about money but def shouldn't have taken it. hindsight 20/20). Anyway, I'm interviewing elsewhere and things are going well, but I keep thinking about that job!

The day comes when i get this dog and hes adorable, he bonded with me so easily and i thought he was the one for me, until a couple days pass and i start feeling really exhausted and tired after taking care of him, this might have been normal so i brushed it off as not getting enough sleep. After more days i still felt like this and it really took a toll on me, i could barely get out of bed, i couldn't be able to do half the things i enjoy, and i could barely take care of myself. I have a problem where i forget very easily and that makes me paranoid that i might forget to do something for him one day. I had an instance today that i broke down from how exhausted i was, i have to admit my mother drove two hours to get him and i feel horrible to tell her how i feel.

1d3jmwk,university,Review on IU International University of Applied Sciences - Berlin  ,"While I appreciate the knowledge gained from the courses, my overall experience at IU as an international student has been far from pleasant. Here are the main reasons why I urge prospective students to reconsider their decision:

Academic Challenges and Lack of Support:

Throughout my journey, and that of my classmates, we encountered numerous challenges with the courses and the university itself. Many of these issues could have been easily resolved, but despite reaching out for help, the staff consistently failed to assist or even respond to my concerns.

Weak Administration:

The administrative processes at the university have been a constant source of frustration. From delayed responses to bureaucratic red tape, navigating the system has been overwhelming. Simple tasks, such as accessing examination grades or clarifying an open invoice, have been unnecessarily complicated and time-consuming. If one has an issue, there is often no one who can help, even when help is promised. The system is too rigid and unresponsive.

Lack of Communication:

There have been numerous instances of miscommunication or a complete lack of communication from various departments. Important information was often relayed late or not at all, leaving students in difficult positions.

Student Well-being:

From my own experience and from speaking with other students, it’s clear that the challenges and issues caused by IU have led to significant anxiety and stress. The constant struggles have drained our energy and resources, which we should have been able to devote to our studies.

Lack of Transparency:

The school often seems to find ways to extract money from students, creating structures that force students into unfair and uncomfortable situations. When seeking clarification, responses were either unavailable or unclear.

Looking forward, I share these reflections not out of bitterness, but to raise awareness and in the hope of seeing improvements for future students.",2024-05-29 18:46:51,3,1,1,Positive,0.035539215686274515,0,0,2

1dkfs88,academia,advice on whether or not I should continue with my masters in neuroscience?,"so I know this may seem like an odd questions to ask strangers but I'm looking for advice from people who are already finished their masters so I get a feel for what to expect. I graduated with my bachelors in biology in 2016 and due to family and personal problems I completely let go of all my ambitions and plans to continue my education. I always loved the learning part and things came easy to me so I finished with a 3.9 GPA. but I had anxiety and hated labs and the non-objective testing like papers. so I didn't do a thesis and decided to graduate without honours. 

fast forward to 2023 and I applied to a competitive neuroscience masters program at Humboldt University of Berlin (started in 2024, a semester late due to health problems). I've always loved Germany and it seemed like a great idea. but now I'm not sure this is the right path for me. when I got accepted into the program, it felt like my life finally had direction because I did always want to go into neuroscience but then I was never big on being in the stressful field of research, grants and having my superiors yell at me if I mess something up (I know thats pretty much life). that's why I hated lab courses. I only loved learning and having my knowledge tested which i know sounds stupid but I think I've confused my love of learning with the idea of loving research. 

we're doing MRI analysis stuff and the idea of having to do this for the rest of my life is quite depressing. also, I feel like I've become really stupid in the 8 of being of school. since I was unclear of what I wanted to do after undergrad, I took a lot of difficult courses from from different fields of study, like calculus advanced stats and others that weren't needed fro my bio degree. and I've forgotten pretty much everything. so I feel like i I know less than I did in high school even! 

I'm not sure I'm just panicking over not understanding things when everything used to come so easy to me but I'm back to full an anxiety and the thought of writing paper after paper to only end up with a degree that will stick me with writing more papers and being in the stressful environment of research is not making much sense anymore. 

Also, I'm from Canada so I've left everything and everyone I know behind. and as much as I love Berlin, Toronto is my home and I'd want to go back. so it's like I'd have to build a life here for the next 2.5 years just to uproot my life again to move back and start from 0.

another key fact is that my parents are financing all this as I have no saving of my own (the 8 years of problems didn't leave room for savings and life, really) and haven't been able to get a job here yet. so its a huge pressure on me so I have to consider the cost of my life here in Berlin too. 

sorry for the long post but I'd really appreciate some advice or sources where I could get more info to decide if this is the right path for me. ",2024-06-20 16:24:14,1,5,1,Positive,0.06516830870279147,0,0,2
1b5vpal,stress,We have a switch inside our physical body to counteract stress.,"It goes unnoticed, is unknowingly activated daily by most for other reasons.  


  
What does inspiring movie scenes, songs that move us or just human interaction with loved ones all have in common? They activate this powerful blissful energy inside of us that is commonly known as Frisson, Euphoria, Prana, Qi and can be most easily felt within us when we experience chills/goosebumps from positive events/stimuli.  


  
This soothing energy can be learned to be activated as you please without any outside stimuli, just the simple intention of experiencing it. So imagine how helpful it can be when faced with unwanted stress/anxiety. You can even feel it over your whole body, flooding your being with its natural ecstasy and master it to the point of controlling its duration.  


  
This has been documented, many years ago, in the eastern part of the world as they discovered that it can be made to flow through the body via channels coined as Meridians or Nadis that encompass the entire human body.  


  
It has been researched and documented under many names like Bioelectricity, Life force, Prana, Chi, Qi, Orgone, Rapture, Tension, Aura, Euphoria, Ecstasy, Mana, Vayus, ASMR, Nen, Intent, Tummo, Odic force, Kriyas, Pitī, Frisson, Ruah, Spiritual Energy, Secret Fire, The Tingles, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Aether, Chills, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.   


  
Why is this important? Too many sources point us to outside substances to manage stress, as if the human body wasn't designed to be able to rely on itself for its own internal problems.  


  
Now for some of you that say that stress is good should consider that there are two types of stress and oxidative stress has been linked to several neurological diseases (i.e., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, depression, and memory loss). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724665/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2724665/)  


  
If you are interested in using your ''Frisson switch'', here are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) going more in-depth on how to control your energy and to understand where it comes from.   


  
P.S. Everyone feels it at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on r/spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it.",2024-03-03 23:32:43,1,0,1,Positive,0.19642599464028038,0,0,2
1eqkves,careeradvice,Leave marketing for law career?,"I have been in a consumer marketing role for around 10 years, slowly begun to strongly dislike it with the politics etc. Throughout grade school and university I had always wanted to pursue law, but never did for various reasons. Now I can't stand the thought of working with n marketing for the next 30 years and am worried about layoffs once I reach 50, as I don't know many 50yo in the business world. I have two kids and approx $60k student debt from bachelors and an mba, but am strongly considering going to law school. Pros and cons below

Pros
- Potential law income is very high
- No maxing out of salary unlike marketing
- Get to do something way more interesting and law is more black and white than marketing
- Help people and businesses
- Less likely to be laid off at 50
- Can open own practice in future
- Immediate family are in the area I would study in (currently no family around us)
- Get to be out of marketing, which is turning so digital/social focussed which I dislike

Cons
- My marketing role pays around $130k
- 3 years of school/3 years of lost income
- Already in 60k student debt
- Have kids
- Would need to move province
- Potential high income is just that, potential

I am still leaning heavily towards law. Located in Canada.

1es9sdr,college,Running a club,"Hi y’all

I was give a president position for an organization that I’ve been for the past 2-3 years but I’m kind of nervous being the one who has to run everything and call the shots. I know running the club isn’t like the craziest thing ever - but regardless, I’m still pretty anxious about being in leadership position, especially as a person who doesn’t seem like the typical leader.

Most of the previous members who had been there for years graduated last year and it has been difficult to get their advice for some aspects of the club. So far, I’ve been learning things along the way, like having to fill out the funding application and allocating the tasks to people during the summer. Sometimes the other board members who are new will ask me something I do not know but try my best to look into. 

Do any of you have any advice on how to run your club and not get overwhelmed with things?

I am trying my best to just dedicate a bit of time to it each day so that I don’t get super overwhelmed but I’m just worried that things will pile up during the school year and studying for a standardized exam, research, and job stuff. I’m also pretty nervous about public speaking, so leading the meetings each week is pretty daunting. I think I was mainly given this position for how much time I dedicated to the club the previous years and just based of seniority, rather than actually being a good leader.

Thank you for any advice!",2024-08-14 18:57:38,2,1,1,Positive,0.1681818181818182,0,0,2

When I was finished, I lowkey just started laughing to myself like someone in an insane asylum. I decided that the best way to de-stress was to go onto the campus forest (I go to an arts highschool) and scream to the top of my lungs, just to let it all out. I pretty much just tweaked out the whole adventure there, laughing to myself along the way and almost disassociating. It’s really snowy where I am now, so I was in performance clothes with flats on and it was really cold, snow getting in my shoes and everything. I didn’t really care to be honest, I was pretty out of my mind tbh(still kinda am). I was just haphazardly laughing to myself, and singing some of my Bourre and making funny noises. When I got back to the practice room ,after pushing down a music stand and throwing a phone off it’s handle, I had to convince myself not to destroy the entire area, including my bow and my computer screen.

Well… I’m doing it again. 

I don’t want to, there are just no other decent paying jobs around me so it’s my only option really. To be honest though, everything I mentioned above is not what I disliked about a trade. It’s the learning, the stress of slowing down the team, the stress of fucking up someone’s house, and the constant dread of having to worry about everything again the next day. 

I was let go from HVAC because it was winter and business slowed down. So really I’m left here now stressing on if I’ll be good enough or fast enough.

1efcsvc,university,Best Path to Canadian Med School: Staying In-Province VS Pursuing Dream School,"Hi, hope everyone’s summer is going good! I’m an upcoming grade 12 student and I’m having trouble deciding where to go for university for a life sci/health sci program hoping to go into medicine. I understand the importance of choosing a university that offers the best chances for getting into medical school. As a Saskatchewan resident, attending USask over universities like UBC, UofT, or Western would likely improve my chances due to the higher acceptance rates for in-province students at many Canadian medical schools. Given that I didn't grow up in those provinces, I would be considered an out-of-province applicant elsewhere.

Everyone around me has advised me to stay and attend USask because it seems like a smarter and more practical choice. It would allow me to focus on studying without the stress of adjusting to a new environment, especially since USask is known for its relatively easier coursework and living at home would be more convenient.

However, I’ve always dreamed of moving out for university, and attending one of the top programs in Canada, like life sciences at UofT, has been a significant motivator throughout high school. While I know staying at USask is the practical choice, the thought of staying here feels like I'm giving up on a childhood dream. I understand that the university I attend for undergrad doesn’t determine my entire future, but I struggle with abandoning something I've always wanted. Moreover, I'm not 100% certain about pursuing medicine, and I don’t want to base my university decision on an uncertain future.

Should I choose USask, which offers the best chance of getting into medical school, or follow my dream and attend a top program elsewhere? Sorry, I know this might be childish but I’m pretty conflicted :( Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",2024-07-29 22:22:55,1,0,1,Positive,0.16575439266615738,0,0,2

1ejka7b,stress,Animal stress love and worry,"Lately I lost a lot of my animals. I’m stressed out my families not helping matters. I took care of some animals that were a good chance that they wouldn’t make it three incidents in a row well, somewhat close to same. I lost animals I know over the years. I’m going to lose more because I’ve had so many animals.

But I am stressed out but my way venting to my family. I hope the fish don’t die cause the reason we lost the dang fish because I really like the two that we just got we got more than that but I really like the two and the recent deaths I’ve been told my mindset will kill them. Is it so wrong for me hoping praying that I won’t lose any more animals saying I hope these ones don’t die because I really like them. I will make them die sooner if I keep saying or thinking that way, how can you change that when you’re really just praying that you don’t lose no more animals

It’s crazy. I have cameras in my room just for my animals. I shouldn’t have to worry about my mother‘s cat breaking into my room sometimes while I’m gone, if that happens could kill my gerbils my birds sometimes it helps having cameras, but then the thought of the house caught on fire or my cameras are messed up. I get more stressed , but one of my animals are dying and I can’t save it, but I’m able to see it on camera shouldn’t have to be this stressed out. Shouldn’t be gaslighted. Told my mind that will just kill my animals faster or other things like that. I can’t change the way. My mind works. I’m sorry I’m praying and hoping my animals don’t die 

Taking one vet soon. which is far away because I have birds and no good vets for birds are around here. I lost so many birds because I couldn’t take them to the vets. My morning routine is looking making sure my bird is not dead on the bottom of the cage, this stress is so much I have so many animals so many cages spent so much money on these recently bought bigger cages for my rabbits and the birds sometimes right now I just wanna get rid of all my animals

I’m looking into learning CPR better I know CPR but I need to know how much pressure to put on a bird or even small animals like gerbil and rabbits and other animals I done CPR but also probably don’t put enough pressure so I’m going to try to get training just for CPR because I’ve had so many animals that I’ve tried to use it on. It wouldn’t hurt to learn.more 

Just needed to come here and vent like I said I’m freaking stressed out. I recently did lose one of my birds. I was trying to get it to the vet as soon as possible. My mom didn’t think it needed it. It was young. Maybe it was losing that much weight because it was in the mist of still growing Behavior didn’t change much but I knew something was wrong a couple days. It only took a couple days. It was a lot of weight. I held it. Let it rest cause it was very sleepy and was pretty sure it was sick so I wanted to get some sleep and try to heal until I can get it to the vet not long I turn around it died on the bottom of the cage, my heart is so broken right now I’m trying to handle everything then told I’m just gonna kill my animal more because my mind instead of telling me and hoping hoping and praying begging for no more to die that one was a rescue one I was feeding it. It was hand fed finally eating on its own. It went downhill fast, but my mindset. I will just kill my animals basically that I’m cruising them because I’m hoping and praying no more die.

1erw98q,college,Housing search is stressing me out,"I got accepted into a grad program in June. I’ve been searching for housing everywhere all of July and August. I’m coming from out of town so I even bothered family to tour some places for me. I thought I had secured a place until today. A quick summary of what happened, a girl at my school is doing a year abroad and wants someone to sublet her place. I negotiated the price with her, video chatted. All was good until she said she had to get the ok from her mom. Her mom is a real estate agent and does the usual credit inspection and all that. I’m a bit uneasy because the sublet is technically through the school since it’s school property but the mom doesn’t trust me at all. Anyway I don’t put up a fight and give her all the documents. Mom is starting to get very involved now. Mom keeps asking to give her my current landlord info, but I keep telling her I live with my parents who own the house and I do not have a landlord. Mom is also unhappy with how I filled out my past employment. I was a supply teacher for a few months and didn’t have a fixed job location, supervisor or income (got paid for however many days I worked). She couldn’t accept that as an answer. After much explaining from me she lets these go. Daughter and I continue to text during this time discussing other details and I keep asking when she will submit the form to the school for approval and everyday she says today, but it’s been a week. She says her mom wants to do a three way call to meet me and I say ok fine. On the call mom restates the lease terms and it’s completely different from what I discussed with her daughter. I even had screenshots to prove it. Mom blames it on her daughter being 19 and not knowing better. Mom now wants me to pay the entire lease duration (12 months) all at once. I say no, the most I can do is one semester at once. Now mom is suspicious I don’t have money. She asks me if I’m not working, I’m not waiting for the money so if I have enough right now why can’t I pay it all. I couldn’t believe I had to explain to a grown woman that I have enough money, it doesn’t mean I want to hand over 20k right now and I want to have some for other costs like tuition and emergency funds. Then she asks what emergency? I just say health, visiting parents, if I need to fly someone. Then she starts reading into my words she’s like fly? To see your parents? I thought your parents owned a house here? At that point I was like oh my fucking god how is this woman a real estate agent. She starts saying how it’s not safe for her daughter if I don’t pay on time. I’m like dude, just put it in the lease that I have to pay monthly and if I don’t evict me. But she won’t and keeps insisting I need to pay all of it at once. She says trusts me but clearly she doesn’t. Mom then asks if she can talk to my parents. Dude I’m 24. When this happened I was staying with my partner, I wasn’t even at my parents house. I didn’t tell her more than ‘my parents aren’t home’. She just sits there and watches me while I pretend to text and call my parents. Until she can’t wait anymore to go to her yoga class. I was so upset and felt so disrespected I called my dad crying afterwards. My family is decently well off but we try to be frugal. My dad comforts me by saying we can pay all of it at once but he wants to see the lease first. I’m still pretty shaken up and don’t really want to deal with this mom anymore. I won’t be surprised if she wants to charge me to se the lease. To make things worse I found out how much she actually pays for rent and the mom is gaslighting me thinking I’m getting a good deal but they’re actually profiting! I probably sound like such a baby right now but you can’t tell me that this mom is being normal. She’s way too involved and assuming things about me. It’s the middle of the night and for now I’m waiting for them to send me the lease. Based on this event I likely will not proceed but I’m worried that they can’t do something against me since they have my application form, copy of my ID, my address, credit report. 2 weeks left until grad school starts and I’m already stressed enough about my program and this lady just made my day worse :(",2024-08-14 08:23:13,1,1,1,Positive,0.11996420246420246,0,0,2

1cx6th4,stress,I’m in the same state all the time and don’t feel any emotions - is this dissociation due to stress? ,"I went through a very stressful and traumatic time last summer which made me develop insomnia and anxiety and I wasn’t able to sleep for 3 weeks. 
Ever since I’ve not experienced my feelings and emotions at all and I’m afraid this is due to dissociation. I also had extreme dizziness for about 8 weeks but this has now disappeared. 

However, for the past 9 months I have not felt tired, hungry or full and I also no longer feel the effect of alcohol. I’m on the following anti depressants and anti psychotics: sertraline 200mg, lamotrigine 50mg, quetiapine 400mg and amilsulpride 50mg.

However I’m not sure if it’s helping at all because I just feel like I’m stuck in the same state all the time. It’s really the most horrible feeling and I feel like nothing can make me feel any different and I just feel so empty. I also have a loop of a song constantly stuck in my head 24/7. In addition, I experience social anxiety and feel I can no longer hold a conversation as I feel my mind is blank and I can only focus on how bad I am feeling all the time. 

I wanted to hear if anyone else has experienced similar symptoms and what you did to address them? Would TMS work? At this point I’m desperate to try anything as I just want to feel better and I’m not sure how much longer I can go feeling like this.",2024-05-21 12:35:16,1,2,1,Negative,-0.05295698924731182,0,0,0
193gbjf,stress,Caffeine induced stress,"If stress and high sympathetic nervous system activity affects our health so negatively, how can something like coffee (even black without milk and sugar) be advertised as beneficial and healthy? 
I stopped coffee a few days ago as I correlated it with my acne and I’m already noticing improvements in my health besides my skin! 
Wow, cant wait for more caffeine free days and better health. 

Side note: I started drinking coffee only two years ago when I was 23 years old. 
Since then I’ve noticed many health issues like IBS flareups, decreased HRV, irritability and anxiety, sleep issues, shallow breath, skin issues, increased period cramps (omg, the worst), getting sick much more often and many more …

1dzleyn,stress,"How to Deal with Anxiety About Going Back to College
","So, I am a first-year student going into my second year. I am studying computer science in college and failed two major subjects in my second semester. These subjects have the highest credits, and I can retake the exams at the end of the next semester, but I constantly feel like I made a stupid mistake by focusing elsewhere.

There's also a social internship program, usually worth 1 credit, which requires a signature from the village head. I haven't gotten it yet, and with only 4 days remaining, I feel like I won’t be able to complete it.

Additionally, my college asked for a character certificate, which I haven't submitted yet. I came from open schooling, which doesn’t provide a character certificate, so I would need to contact the police department or court for one, but I haven't done that either.

The biggest issue is that I am going back to college in 4 days. I will meet new people this semester, live in a different place, and everything is freaking me out.",2024-07-10 03:07:08,2,4,1,Negative,-0.001746632996632981,0,0,0
18rqhz3,stress,Flashes of mild pressure in head?,"I am coming down from a stressful period with school and finals. Its been a couple of weeks or so. My Christmas break has been mildly stressful but not too bad.

I have had these occasional flashes/swells/surges of pressure and kinda a head ache. It is not a atrong pressure, and they flash by within a few seconds. They occur on one side. I have had a couple brief sinus headaches on the right side a couple times this week as well. I think most of thw pressures that come and go also happen mostly on thw right side, if not both at once.

They aren't really painful or very strong at all. Just, my family has a hist of stress related heart issues and ill health effects. My dad has even experienced what I believe to have possibly been an aneurysm. I know it probably sounds unlikely, but what he experienced strongly sounds like one. He definitely has brain damage as well, and has deteriorated even more over time due to alcoholism and heavy prescription use.

I have somewhat of a phobia of brain damage and heart issues seem pretty scary to me. I have had some pretty bad mental fog from stresss and heart palpitations. I suppose I am. a bit worried about these weird headaches as well.

1eps88a,careeradvice,Exit interview - To decline/accept?,"I handed in my resignation end of this week for a role that I loved but my manager was impossible to work with - he harassed me on multiple occasions, was disrespectful, didn't notify me of any clear deadlines, tried to throw me under the bus on emails for shit I never did, took credit for all my work, etc.. 

I had put in the harassment complaint to HR but they came back with the conclusion your boss shouldn't have yelled at you in front of everyone, but roles in finance are stressful and things like this are bound to happen and both of you are new here. Basically it sounded like they were trying to defend my boss. I also brought up how he is trying to get me into shit for things I didn't fuck up on and if you look at original data or files, you can follow the trail on who it was. HR completely ignored this concern. I asked for summary of what was discussed as response to my email. HR refused. 

Ever since my boss found out I complained to HR, he just started going after me more and his way of working is one on one onsite meetings, so he could cover his track I imagine. 

HR asked my last day be end of next week despite the 4 weeks I gave in as mentioned on my contract and requested an exit interview. I don't really know what to expect out of exit interview and should I be accepting or declining it? Is it mandatory?

1ekfuic,careeradvice,Regretting accepting a full-time role ,"Around 3 months ago I took a casual role as a customer service coordinator with a real estate company. Up until now I’ve worked around 3-4 days per week and recently was offered a full time, permanent role, which I have taken.

It’s slowly daunting on my the decision I’ve made. I don’t mind the role itself, it’s not particularly enriching or interesting but also not too stressful. However I feel like up until this point I haven’t been provided with adequate training to succeed in a permanent role. 

To further that, my manager just resigned as well as three other permanent staff in the past month, which makes me worried about what I’ve possibly gotten myself into, it also suggests that I will not be receiving the training I need. 

Shift times are strict, and the vibe I have gotten is there is not really any flexibility e.g. leaving early to attend a doctors appointment. I’ve also heard from my co-workers that there is no prospect of any pay rises and upper management is toxic.

Have I made the wrong decision going full time? Is it worth seeing it out for the first couple months before looking for something else? Currently stressed out!

18mnrvk,students,How I(A 16-year-old) Trained my brain to do Twice the work and increase my productivity,"Hey there reddit!!Hope y'all are doing great and having the absolute best time of your life... I am a 16-year-old teenager from India who is really a tech freak and loves to find ways to make the best out of his work and studies... recently I faced a situation where I felt like I was working all day and getting no work done.. sounds weird but I Feel some people can realte to me in this, I studied about it for a while and came up with many conclusions that helped me improve my way of learning or working and provided me twice the output I usually had.... Here are some tips I'd like to share that I learned are the most effective-  


1. Morning routines are one of the most important things that you can create in your life. By doing so, you can overcome all of the chaos that comes with every day and accomplish the most important things first.To do your morning routine well, you want to get plenty of sleep, either meditate or work out, and make sure that you have the energy levels that you need to get things done. This is what Tim Ferriss calls optimizing for the lead Domino.
2. I eat whole foods, mostly during the week, and reduce sugar. This allows me to have tremendous focus, a lot of energy, get the most out of my workouts, maintain my body composition, keep my fat low, and keep my glycemic spikes low, which helps me maintain my energy through the day.
3. In the morning, I try to get direct sunlight into my eyes and let that set my circadian rhythm for about.I stopped checking my text messages usually two hours before I go to bed because the most stressful things in my life come in via text message so I know better so I try to stop that two hours before.If you find yourself at night having a hard time falling asleep, put your air pods in, put on a fiction book, and leave the book running. You will fall asleep and then the pressure comes off your ear and you can no longer make out what they're saying.

hope this post was helpful to many of you, if it was then please consider checking out my newsletter for more findings that i had regarding the same, I've always felt the need to share my learnings with others and I feel like this newsletter has given me the chance to do so, here is the link - https://ascension.beehiiv.com

16u1ecm,stress,is stress the reason for my physical ailments?,"hello. I have had terrible years of trauma, about 8 years of dealing with my dad falling sick from cancer multiple times and many other complications. I was primary care giver during a significant event and also this 8 years was when I was young, basically late teen to early 20s. It's been 3 years now and I have finally come around to excepting trauma and experiencing grief. I dont know why it took me 3 years.  
I think I am connecting physical ailments to this and wondering if they are related. I have high resting heart rate: \~110 bpm and have had that for years. I think I started to observe it in early 20s (when i was still in the middle of the storm). I have had all checkups/tests done and my heart is healthy from physical perspective. So far I thought that maybe it's my normal but now I wonder if it is connected to stress I was under and the stress that had become my normal. Is that a thing? I am not talking about high heart rate during panic attack, I am talking about just a high heart rate. Is therapist a right person to answer this? all medical reports come normal.  
I have also been someone who would throw up after a stressful situation. But these days I have terrible chest pain due to acidity. and medically there's a reason i.e. I have hiatal hernia. However, I have had this since a long time and it never gave me chest pain. Now it does when I am kind of in the middle of processing trauma. I wonder if this elevated symptoms are also connected to stress. Does this hunch makes sense?   
Thank you in advance. I know this is reddit and not an actual medical appointment. :) I just thought maybe I could get some insight/xperience that anyone would like to share/answer.",2023-09-28 00:36:48,2,2,1,Positive,0.009906015037593979,0,0,2

Every second I think about work and get anxiety/panic attacks thinking what next fcuk up might be. The first year here I learnt so much. The way to function, to manage and handle things and platforms. 
But since the last couple of months it feels like my trajectory is just going downwards. I have been shifted to a new dept with same working system but different client. I'm the only person who is responsible for all the things. There's a new joinee but they're of no help.

And despite working late hours, putting my interests aside there's no appreciation. I'm okay with no getting appreciation but atleast I shouldn't be getting yelled at every now and then.
All this has impacted my physical and mental health. I'm starting to forget and miss out things, I have lost my appetite and weight, waking up with constant dread and anxiety. 
I don't get a moment to myself.
Even on my sick days, my boss calls me for work requests post 7 as technically the work hours are done and so is the sick leave.
The reason that I am hesitant to leave is because what if this is all inside my head and that maybe I'm not working hard enough? What if I'm just lazy.? What if I don't land a job even though everyone around me says I'm capable.

I just need to understand what the heck to do?

Ps. I don't have a job offer in hand. But I have money saved that can last over a year.

My contracted hours are 9-5.30 in the office 5 days a week and on Friday the boss told me to have a meeting and kept me waiting until 6.30 purposely to make a point. He then told me he had no complaints with my first week but essentially told me off for leaving at 5.30 and said I need to stay later to work into the evening. I was so shocked, why did he not tell me this at the beginning of the week? He told me there is no overtime pay and it's part of the culture. He said it's a bad influence on the other staff if I leave at 5.30. I also work through lunch everyday as the culture there also seems to be to not take a lunch break...is this normal? If I work any more hours at this wage I'm essentially making less than minimum wage let alone London living wage.

1daicp1,stress,Illness symptoms from stress? ,"31M UK. 
I part own and run a company with 25 staff, I have three children and one dog. 

For the last four years on/off I have suffered from the following symptoms; anxiety, stress, headaches, GERD, fatigue & nausea. More recently - dizzyness with nausea and muscle pain. 

Can this is all stem from stress? My bloods are normal, my heart is normal & blood sugar is all good - the only aspect medically is my iron is slightly low 63 (but still considered within range). I also randomly have good days where I feel perfect however they are becoming quite rare. 

I find that exercise helps but last week I had a hernia op so can’t currently exercise which is more than likely why my symptoms are now becoming even worse (mainly nausea, muscle pain and dizziness) which makes it very hard to function normally. 

Can anyone relate? Any advice would be very much appreciated as I want to beat it 💪

Thank you in advance. ",2024-06-07 18:42:33,1,3,1,Positive,0.18221153846153848,0,0,2
1c3kj1l,students,Did my teacher hate me?idkkk,"I had this one teacher who for some reason never really tried to talk to me. I know I was awkward in their class and I rarely talked to people, but even when I would be with my friends, they would talk and acknowledge everyone around me but me. They never actually tried to talk, but keep in mind they talk to everyone, just not me for some reason even though I show at times that I can talk despite being reserved. Also I wasn't really the best student, I had a lot of anxiety in class and almost rarely talked, they called me about twice or three times that school year to answer a question in class. I didn't put in effort to do work because I was just too anxious and felt like I could be judged, but eventually I got better through the year. 

I wonder if perhaps they disliked me or maybe something I do that comes off as weird(I hope not) because they'd joke and tease everyone at some point. With me though, they'd say small things about my work like Good Job, You have great handwriting, and other things like that. They're a troll in class, they like to troll, annoy, and tease the students, but with me they've never done any of that but are more formal with me. Though I do catch them looking at me from afar at times, they manage to make me feel like I don't exist in class. Idk I might be reading too into it though.

1d81onn,academia,I am an academic who loves teaching but hates research. ,"Throwaway account for privacy.

I hold a doctorate in economics from one of the top (first-generation) IITs (not the new IITs) in India.  I have one ‘good’ publication (A/A\* journal) and working towards at least one more A/B publication. For the past decade or so, I have been teaching in non-tenured roles before and after receiving my PhD (A doctoral degree is not a requirement to teach at the college level in India). Additionally, I have tutored college students from India, US and UK.

My concern: **I love teaching, but hate research.** I like writing, but I hate publishing academic papers. I enjoy number-crunching, but despise indulging in excessively complicated econometrics just to make the paper “look cool”. I love the flexibility and freedom of academia, but hate the long-drawn and uncertain peer review process.

Ideally, I would like a teaching-focused (in-person) University job, but those places demand that one spends 8-9 hours on campus (even on days/times you don't have lectures). What’s the point of being an academic if I have to be tied to a desk for 8 hours? Mind you, it is not that these places are paying a bomb either, so there is no compensating differential.

The jobs that give more freedom ask for high-quality research, which I don’t want to do, and I don’t think I am good at either. Each time I attend a conference, I get a massive imposter syndrome and end up realizing that I can never do research at “that” level (I have seen people run 23 robustness checks and merging 7 datasets to answer their research question). The truth is—I don’t even want to do this kind of work. **I don’t understand the purpose of publishing research**, which will be read by a maximum of 5 people and will be inaccessible to most others—I would rather write an opinion piece which can be read and understood by many readers.

I have tried (re)learning advanced econometrics to do ‘better’ (read: more complicated) research, but it looks like I have missed the bus on it, and I am too old to learn it now.

I plan to retire after 15 years, so I don’t exactly care about becoming a Full Professor before retirement. I just want to do work that I enjoy, and not feel stressed over insignificant p-values.

Recently, I freelanced as an SME/content editor for an international ed-tech company, and I really enjoyed the work (basically, I was doing a quality check for e-lessons, and verifying if the math equations/graphs/calculations are accurate). However, there seems to be some sort of a hiring freeze and I now observe that similar roles are not available to Indians anymore. Similar companies in India pay peanut skins.

Ideally, I would love a mix of in-person University-level teaching, and some academic content development/content review (mostly remote work). Since I have mostly been working as an Adjunct Lecturer, I get paid per course and am usually available when the semester is not in session, so I can do both things together.

So I guess what I am asking is:

1.      What are my options as an academic who doesn’t like academic research? I don't want to leave teaching, because I like it, and I am good at it (read: stellar course evaluations, teaching awards, very favourable comments by students).

2.      I don’t want to get into traditional non-academic jobs (like policy research) since I value freedom, and don’t work well with large teams. Moreover, I neither want to sit in office for the whole day, nor want to participate in endless meetings and brainstorming. I am fine with shorter project-based work though. The challenge is to find such opportunities.

3.      Is it a waste of my degree to not stay in academia? I have been a top student throughout my academic journey--am I letting all that go to nought if I quit?

4.      Any skills I need to build to break into academic content writing/editing/curriculum development etc?

Note: Cross posted in Indian Academia (waiting for mod's approval)

1egpeyh,academia,Advice on Transitioning to Physics as an Economics Graduate,"Hi,

I’m reaching out for some advice on an academic dilemma I’m facing. I’ve recently graduated with a BSc in Economics from the University of Bristol, however I did not find my course very stimulating or insightful. I feel my true passion lies in physics and mathematics, which I only began to discover during my undergraduate years (I studied maths, further maths, physics, and economics at A-level).

I would like to continue my education rather than scramble around for an unfulfilling corporate job, which was once the plan. 

My main concern is that my economics background has backed my into a corner, academically speaking. As such, I’m worried the transition from economics will not be financially or logistically feasible as I would have to take another 3 years of undergraduate physics without funding.

I’m hoping to find a more seamless switch between the two fields, so my main questions are:

1) Are there any accelerated programs that could catch me up on the necessary coursework without having to start from scratch?

2) Are there any scholarships at repeatable institutions that would fund my undergraduate studies, and how likely would it be to get onto one of these?

3) Are there any postgraduate programs that combine elements of economics and physics or mathematics, which might be more accessible given my current qualifications? (Probably a long shot)

I would greatly appreciate any insights, experiences, or general advice that would lead me down the right path.

Many thanks.",2024-07-31 15:02:52,1,4,1,Positive,0.15953968253968254,0,0,2

1dunzj8,stress,Understanding Anxiety: Causes and Coping Strategies,"Anxiety is a common mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Understanding its causes and finding effective coping strategies can make a significant difference in managing anxiety and improving overall well-being.

# Causes of Anxiety:

Anxiety can stem from various factors, including:

* **Genetics:** Research shows that anxiety disorders can run in families, suggesting a genetic component.
* **Brain Chemistry:** Imbalances in neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine can contribute to anxiety.
* **Environmental Factors:** Stressful life events, trauma, and significant changes can trigger anxiety.
* **Personality:** Individuals with certain personality traits, such as high sensitivity, may be more prone to anxiety.

According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults each year.

# Coping Strategies:

Managing anxiety involves a combination of self-care practices and professional support. Here are some effective strategies:

* **Mindfulness and Meditation:** Practices like mindfulness meditation can help calm the mind and reduce anxiety.
* **Physical Activity:** Regular exercise releases endorphins, which can alleviate anxiety symptoms.
* **Healthy Lifestyle Choices:** A balanced diet, adequate sleep, and avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol can improve mental health.
* **Therapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is particularly effective in treating anxiety disorders.
* **Support Network:** Connecting with friends, family, or support groups can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation.

Understanding the root causes of anxiety and integrating lifestyle changes with professional treatment can empower individuals to regain control over their lives.

Got a dog that was hyper that caused stress but I didn't mind since my husband got for us. Did a deep cleaning and found pests that made me feel disgusting. Started back at my old job but was reminded of what I lost..family member inthe hospital.

1adybhn,stress,I can’t feel the physical stress response anymore?,"Some background: I have been through many periods in my life of extreme stress activation and fight mode in terms of anxiety (throwing up, losing 10 kilos because of not being able to hold down food, staying awake for 80 hours because I could not sleep, my BPM constantly at 140 etc etc). Then I have gone into complete shut down and freeze mode due to depression. This up and down cycle has basically been my adult life. However, I healed from the depression by learning to feel and accept my feelings again (at that point I hadn’t cried in like 10 years). BUT, my last shutdown lasted six months which I spent in bed doing nothing. Worst part is, I wasn’t depressed or anxious or anything. I just think I experienced a really bad ADHD-paralysis.

Anyways, ever since I came out of the last depression and shutdown I don’t feel like I experience a physiological stress reaction ever? I have been in extremely stressful situations, and I’m definitely thinking about these things, but my body is like “meh”. No activation, no nothing. And ngl it’s nice, but I can’t help but feel that a healthy stress (which I have not experienced since my teens), would have been good for me in terms of my procrastination. I have tried googling this and can’t seem to find a similar experience.

Another peculiar thing is that my grandma’s pituitary gland literally disappeared into thin air (that’s how it was described to me). She used to have it and now she doesn’t. They could never figure out what happened to it. And this gland in the brain activates the production of cortisol, the stress hormone. Now, it’s probably completely unrelated and I know nothing about hormones and such, but I thought I’d mention it. Can too little cortisol do this to your stress response, or will it have the opposite effect?",2024-01-29 15:45:12,3,8,1,Positive,0.0006944444444444466,0,0,2
1dke2ts,stress,chronic stress- reversing the effects,"Hello,

I've been struggling with low libido, bad mood, brain fog, hair loss and decrease in motivation.  
I believe that this condition stems from chronic stress. I grew up in a really messed up family where beatings, raping and neglection where a daily occurence. For a long time I've been struggling with depression and anxiety. Anyway.. this stuff has passed but the aftermath is still there and now I have to battle that.

I've been to multiple doctors and psychiatrist. My mental health seems to be fine and nearly all my results are within a normal range. The doctors said that these results may stem from current stressfull phases. According to them my past is not related to current hormonal imbalances.

Mostly prolactin is slightly elevated. Here are my last results:  
prolactin: 21.01 ng/ml  
testosteron: 15.48 nmol/l  
LH: 2.3 mIU/ml  
FSH 3.75 mIU/ml

Did someone go through a similar situation, especially regarding the symptoms and had somewhat of a success in battling these..  
Life is getting boring without any motivation to do anything lol  
What is the correct way to proceed in my situation?

18krmno,stress,Some tips on how to avoid stress,"The best way to deal with stress is **prevention**. (a healthy amount of stress is good and necessary for life, but high stress levels are very detrimental to your health and well-being. thankfully, it is possible to prevent them). 

Here are some things that can help: 

1. **Get to know your own stress.** Stress looks different in everyone. It can present itself in many different ways, including physical symptoms and psychological symptoms. It can also have a myriad of different causes. So, it is recommended to learn to interpret your body's and your mind's personal signs of stress so you can anticipate and detect them as early as possible and hopefully prevent the stress from escalating.
2. **Avoid social isolation and solitude.** While social isolation can make you feel better in the short term, your social support system is actually the biggest protective factor against stress. It is crucial to build it up and rely on it in times of stress. 
3. **Humour.** This is a natural way the body has to fight stress. Laughing is very healthy, it releases endorphines (which combat stress and make you feel better), relaxes your muscles, helps your digestion, etc. Using humour to cope also allows you to take a step back and observe your problems under a different angle.  
4. **Reduce fatigue.** You should aim for at least 7 hours of sleep, but it is not only the length that matters: the quality of your sleep is just as important. Your body relies on sleep to repair itself, which it does primarily in the deeper phases of sleep. Your mind uses the paradoxal sleep phase (dreams) to process psychological stuff. There are many techniques that can promote better sleep. (Weed is not one of them. While it may help you sleep, weed negatively impacts the quality of your sleep and can make it hard to fall asleep without it). 
5. **Take breaks.** Taking regular breaks during work, school or study is crucial to prevent stress.
6. **Exercise.** You've heard this one before, but exercise is among the best ways to reduce stress. Exercise helps you sleep at night and promotes wakefulness during the day. It helps you clear your head and it releases endorphins, which reduce your stress levels significantly. And finally, it allows a break for your mind, which allows you to be creative and think about your problems differently. Forms of exercise like hiking are specifically effective for this as they are very meditative. 
7. **Learn to say no.** This can be difficult for many people, but the best way to do this is to practice in small, inconsequential situations. It will become easier and easier. 
8. **Affront your problems.** Surely you've heard of the fight/flight/freeze response. Well, the fight response is actually the best way to deal with your problems. Any other responses will just prolong your stress. 

I'm currently studying for my final in a class on stress so I thought I'd give you guys a little recap of the best ways to avoid stress. Please feel free to ask questions as this will help me study. :) ",2023-12-17 21:21:37,9,1,1,Positive,0.20842592592592593,0,0,2
1bwn1p6,stress,The 10 Most Effective Techniques for Managing Stress and Regaining Calmness,"Stress, in simple terms, is the body's response to any change that requires adjustments or responses and is something that has existed since time immemorial. Humans have experienced stress in various forms, from having to face predators to survive to modern concerns related to work, family, obligations, commitments, and so on.

In contemporary society, stress has become a constant companion for many, with studies suggesting that 83% of workers worldwide suffer from work-related stress. This constant pressure can lead to a range of physical and mental health problems that, if not managed properly, can ruin the lives of those who fail to cope with stress levels derived from daily life.

An effective strategy for managing stress involves adopting time management techniques. Organizing and prioritizing tasks can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed all the time that stress generates, allowing people to address their responsibilities more effectively. In fact, as an example, it is estimated that 30% of workers report that proper time management is the key to reducing stress at work.

In addition to time management, regular practice of relaxation techniques, such as meditation and deep breathing, has been shown to be effective in controlling stress. Meditation, in particular, has gained popularity in recent years, with studies supporting its benefits in reducing cortisol levels, the hormone responsible for generating the anxiety and restlessness caused by stress.

Another approach to controlling stress is to promote a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and sufficient rest. The connection between the body and mind is undeniable, and maintaining a healthy body can strengthen the ability to cope with daily stresses.

Similarly, workplaces and communities that promote a supportive and understanding environment can significantly help reduce the burden of stress. Promoting a culture of well-being in all aspects of life can be crucial to addressing the problem of stress in modern society and offering concrete solutions to those who suffer from chronic stress.

Furthermore sometimes I don’t feel like the course is for me because I’m not the type of person who should be doing this course, everyone on the course is so smart and I’m falling behind everyone. 

Another thing is that my UCAS points aren’t that high so the university I want to go to only offers buisness as a degree or a 2 year sports degree which I’ve both looked into.

As well I have made many friends at the university and it would really be a shame to lose them all as I have not many friends at home who I can talk to.

I need some serious help because I haven’t felt right for the past year and I really don’t know what to do, if I drop out there is nothing back at home for me, if I stay and the workload gets really worse and I fail I’m in more debt for nothing, and if I switch courses I have to be there for another 3 years, I’m really scared about what is going to happen so if anyone could give me some help about this it would be appreciated

I've moved in with my boyfriend and we have a really healthy relationship. He is kind, understanding and has genuinely done wonders for my health and outlook on life. 

We've moved in together around four months ago, which was a stressful process. A lot of 'hurryp up and wait'. But now we are in together, we are really happy with our decision and I love living with him. We are trying for a  child together and have been for the past three months... here's where I need some advice. 

I am not pregnant, but ever since we've started trying my periods have stopped completely and I've not had my period for two months. 

I struggle with having sex sometimes as I was SA'd twice in the  past... unfortunately, both these times led to pregnancy and I had to make the very tricky decision to abort both babies. I still feel guilty about it now, but I know, in that time, I was not in a position to raise either child and nor would they have had stable immediate family. 

My prediction is that it is stress as I have a very tricky job teaching, and the move, and trying for a baby... but I'm very worried. I am unsure what's going on. I'm hoping that someone may be able to shed some light / confirm suspicions. But if it is, I'm not sure what to do. I've never handled stress well. But the sudden stopping my period when i am trying for a baby... even more stress! Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1deef9z,academia,How Researchers Stay Current with New Papers and Developments,"I wrote an article (based on survey with almost 40 respondents) on this specific topic! If you are interested please read:

# Introduction

In today's fast-paced world of scientific research, staying current with the latest developments and literature in one's field is paramount. Researchers who fail to keep abreast of new findings and advancements risk falling behind their peers, missing out on crucial insights, and potentially wasting time and resources on already-explored ideas. Staying up-to-date allows researchers to build upon existing knowledge, identify gaps in the current understanding, and develop innovative solutions to pressing problems.

However, the sheer volume of scientific literature published each year poses significant challenges for researchers trying to stay informed. With countless journals, preprints, and conference proceedings to sift through, it can be overwhelming and time-consuming to identify the most relevant and impactful papers. Furthermore, the increasing specialization of research fields means that important developments may be scattered across multiple disciplines, making it even more difficult for researchers to have a comprehensive overview of their area of study.

To better understand how researchers navigate these challenges, we surveyed participants about their strategies for staying current with the latest literature, their tools, and the obstacles. This article aims to synthesize the insights gained from these responses and provide an overview of the current landscape of scientific literature monitoring. By sharing the experiences and perspectives of researchers across various fields, we hope to foster a discussion on best practices and potential solutions to help researchers stay at the forefront of their disciplines.

# Common Tools and Techniques Used by Researchers

Staying up-to-date with the latest developments in one's field is crucial for researchers. To achieve this, they employ various tools and techniques that help them discover, filter, and organize relevant literature. Among the most popular tools are search engines like Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar, which allow researchers to search for papers using keywords, authors, or citations. These platforms provide access to a vast database of scholarly literature, making it easier for researchers to find relevant papers quickly.

Preprint servers, such as arXiv, have become increasingly popular in recent years. These platforms allow researchers to share their work before it undergoes peer review and publication in a journal. By monitoring preprint servers, researchers can stay informed about the latest findings in their field and engage in discussions with their peers.

Many researchers also rely on journal and conference alerts to stay updated. By subscribing to these alerts, they receive notifications when new papers are published in their areas of interest. This helps them save time by not manually searching for new publications.

Personalized recommendations, such as those provided by Google Scholar alerts, have also become a valuable tool for researchers. These alerts notify users when new papers that match their interests are published, ensuring they don't miss out on important developments in their field.

Social media and networking platforms have also become increasingly important for researchers. Twitter, for example, has become a popular platform for sharing and discussing new research findings. By following relevant hashtags and accounts, researchers can stay informed about the latest developments in their field and engage in discussions with their peers.

Finally, collaboration with colleagues remains a crucial aspect of staying up-to-date with new developments. By attending conferences, participating in journal clubs, and engaging in discussions with their peers, researchers can learn about new findings and ideas that may not be available through other channels.

# Challenges and Pain Points

Staying on top of the latest research developments is a critical task for researchers, academics, and professionals across various fields. However, this process is fraught with numerous challenges and pain points that can hinder their ability to effectively navigate the ever-expanding landscape of scientific literature. Based on the insights gathered from the survey responses, four key issues emerge as the most significant hurdles: information overload and noise, paywalls, and access to papers, time constraints, and keeping up with interdisciplinary research.

## Information Overload and Noise

One of the most prominent challenges highlighted by the respondents is the sheer volume of research papers published daily, leading to information overload. As one participant aptly put it, ""There is a lot of noise and least-publishable-units out there."" The rapid pace of publication across various fields makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to sift through the vast amount of available literature and identify the most relevant and high-quality papers in their areas of interest.

Several respondents expressed their frustration with the high noise levels in their searches, with one stating, ""The noise level was high."" This sentiment is echoed by another participant who wished for ""fewer rubbishy papers!"" The presence of low-quality or irrelevant papers clutters the research landscape, making it harder for researchers to find the most valuable and impactful studies.

To combat this issue, participants employ various strategies, such as relying on specific keywords, filtering by authors or publication venues, and utilizing tools like Google Scholar and arXiv. However, these methods are not always sufficient to cut through the noise effectively. As one respondent noted, ""It doesn't work very well even with specific keywords. I get better results when I search by author and then do further research based on analysis of bibliography of chosen article.""

## Paywalls and Access to Papers

Another significant pain point identified by the respondents is the presence of paywalls and limited access to research papers. Many participants expressed their desire for a more open and accessible research ecosystem, with one stating, ""My magic trick would be all papers and journals publicly available. I have no problem reading and learning things. My real problem is when paying is required to access science and tools.""

Paywalls pose a significant barrier for researchers, especially those affiliated with institutions that may not have subscriptions to all the relevant journals or databases. As one respondent shared, ""When I can't read a paper because is not open, most of the cases I am forced to read another source instead."" This limitation hinders researchers' ability to comprehensively review the literature and stay abreast of the latest developments in their fields.

Some participants rely on their institutional affiliations to access paywalled content, while others resort to alternative sources or settle for reading abstracts and open-access papers. However, these workarounds are not ideal and can lead to an incomplete understanding of the research landscape.

## Time Constraints

Time constraints emerge as another critical challenge for researchers trying to stay on top of the latest literature. With the fast-paced nature of research and the constant influx of new papers, finding the time to thoroughly review and digest the relevant studies can be a daunting task.

Participants reported spending anywhere from a few minutes to several hours per day or week on staying updated with new research. One respondent noted, ""Around 20% of my time is spent on that. However, this is also because I am a reviewer for many of these venues."" The time commitment required to stay current can be substantial, especially for those with multiple research interests or responsibilities.

To manage this challenge, some respondents have developed strategies such as setting aside dedicated time for reading papers, prioritizing based on relevance and quality, and relying on tools and alerts to streamline the process. However, the time investment remains a significant hurdle, with one participant stating, ""The most consuming part is to read and understand the paper. There are a lot of equations and prior knowledge required.""

## Keeping Up with Interdisciplinary Research

As research becomes increasingly interdisciplinary, staying informed about developments in adjacent fields and understanding their potential implications for one's work presents a unique challenge. Participants acknowledged the importance of keeping up with interdisciplinary research but also highlighted the difficulties in doing so effectively.

One respondent noted, ""Working with large ambiguities and uncertainties, and with a lack of previous developments and heritage, one must seek analogies in other fields and industries; recent as well as old papers."" This sentiment underscores the need for researchers to look beyond their immediate areas of expertise and explore connections with other disciplines.

However, identifying and understanding relevant research from other fields can be time-consuming and complex. Participants reported using various strategies, such as attending conferences, engaging in discussions with colleagues from different backgrounds, and using tools like Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar to discover interdisciplinary connections.

Despite these efforts, keeping up with interdisciplinary research remains a significant challenge. One respondent observed, ""It definitely was not the most efficient way to do this."" The lack of standardized keywords, differences in terminology, and the breadth of potentially relevant literature across disciplines can make it difficult for researchers to effectively navigate this landscape.

In conclusion, the challenges and pain points identified by the survey respondents highlight the complex nature of staying on top of the latest research developments. Information overload and noise, paywalls and access limitations, time constraints, and the difficulties of keeping up with interdisciplinary research all contribute to the obstacles faced by researchers in their quest to remain current and informed.

Addressing these challenges will require a multifaceted approach, including the development of more sophisticated tools for filtering and discovering relevant papers, the promotion of open access and the removal of paywalls, and the fostering of interdisciplinary collaboration and communication. By tackling these pain points head-on, the research community can work towards creating a more efficient, accessible, and effective system for staying on top of the latest developments in their fields.

# Desired Improvements and Wishlist

The survey responses reveal a strong desire among researchers for better tools and systems to help them stay on top of the latest developments in their fields. One of the most frequently mentioned improvements is the need for better categorization and filtering of papers. Researchers often find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer volume of new papers published each day, making it difficult to identify the most relevant and important studies. They express a wish for more accurate and specific filters that can help them narrow down their searches based on keywords, topics, or specific subfields. Some respondents even suggest the use of AI or machine learning algorithms to improve the relevance of search results and reduce the noise in the system.

Another common theme in the responses is the desire for personalized recommendations based on individual research interests. Many researchers would like to see a system that can learn from their reading habits and preferences, and suggest new papers that are likely to be of interest to them. This could be achieved through the use of collaborative filtering algorithms, similar to those used by online retailers and streaming services. By analyzing the reading patterns of similar users, the system could make intelligent recommendations and help researchers discover new and relevant papers that they might have otherwise missed.

In addition to personalized recommendations, many researchers also express a desire for summaries and digests of recent developments in their fields. With the rapid pace of scientific progress, it can be challenging to keep up with all the latest findings and breakthroughs. Researchers would appreciate a service that could provide them with concise summaries of the most important papers and developments, allowing them to quickly get up to speed on the latest research without having to read through dozens of individual papers. Some respondents even suggest the use of natural language processing techniques to automatically generate these summaries, saving researchers valuable time and effort.

Another major pain point for researchers is the issue of access to scientific literature. Many respondents express frustration with the current system of paywalls and subscription fees, which can make it difficult or impossible to access important papers and studies. They would like to see a move towards open-access publishing, where all scientific literature is freely available to anyone who wants to read it. This would not only benefit individual researchers but also help to accelerate scientific progress by making it easier for researchers to build on each other's work and collaborate across institutions and disciplines.

Finally, many researchers express a desire for better tools for managing and organizing the papers they read. With the vast amount of literature available, it can be challenging to keep track of all the papers that are relevant to one's research. Respondents mention using a variety of tools, such as reference management software like Zotero and Mendeley, but they would like to see more advanced features and integrations. For example, some researchers suggest the ability to automatically extract key information from papers, such as the main findings and methodologies, and store this information in a structured database for easy retrieval later on. Others would like to see better collaboration features, such as the ability to share and discuss papers with colleagues in real time.

The survey responses reveal a clear need for better tools and systems to help researchers stay on top of the latest developments in their fields. From improved categorization and filtering of papers to personalized recommendations and summaries, to open-access publishing and better management tools, there are many areas where researchers would like to see improvements. By addressing these pain points and wishlist items, we can help accelerate scientific progress and make it easier for researchers to do their important work.

# Importance of Staying Current for Different Groups

Staying up-to-date with the latest research and developments is crucial for various groups, each with their own unique needs and motivations. Here, we discuss the importance of staying current for researchers, industry professionals, and journalists or science communicators.

Researchers, including professors, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students, have a strong need to stay on top of recent literature in their respective fields. Professors and postdocs, especially those seeking tenure-track positions, must ensure their research is original and contributes to the advancement of their field. Graduate students, while often benefiting from the guidance of their supervisors, also need to stay informed about the latest developments to produce novel and impactful work. Regularly reviewing new publications allows researchers to identify gaps in knowledge, spark new ideas, and avoid duplicating efforts.

Industry professionals, particularly those in research and development (R&D) roles or working with cutting-edge technologies, must stay current to remain competitive and drive innovation within their organizations. By keeping abreast of the latest research, they can identify potential applications, anticipate future trends, and make informed decisions regarding product development and strategic planning. Staying up-to-date also enables industry professionals to collaborate effectively with academic researchers and incorporate state-of-the-art techniques into their work.

Journalists and science communicators play a vital role in bridging the gap between the scientific community and the general public. To accurately report on scientific breakthroughs and convey complex concepts to a broad audience, they must have a solid understanding of the latest research. Staying current allows journalists to identify newsworthy findings, provide context, and ensure their reporting is correct. Science communicators who stay informed can also help combat the spread of misinformation by presenting accurate, up-to-date information in an accessible manner.

180reog,stress,Eye strain or age?,"Or both? 45 yo male. Never had glasses in my life. I was born with left eye astigmatism (though being told now it’s not). Left eye has been blurry since birth. Right eye super strong. Last time I had an eye exam was when I was in my early teens. I’ve been working with computers my entire life. I stare at monitors daily for 8-10 hours. I’ve always had on and off eye soreness and headaches after long days. 

About 3-4 weeks ago I started to realize that my vision up close is starting to blur and have headache but behind my eyebrows.  Hard to focus on text. It’s not so much blurry as it is a focus problem I think. I finally went in to eye exam and was given the talk about “in your 40’s vision gets bad. Presbyopia”. I got prescription glasses (OD/OS +.75/+.75 cyl -.50/-.25 axis 91/112) and it seems to be helping with the focus somewhat. I’ve had a lot of health anxiety since this started. 

Thoughts on if it’s just age catching up to me or some prolonged eye strain thing going on? Eye dr said eyes looks great and nothing concerning.",2023-11-21 21:03:33,1,1,1,Positive,0.06898496240601505,0,0,2
1eje0gn,careeradvice,"Feeling a Little Lost at 30 with an MPH and years of experience
","Hi everyone-I would love just some input or advice on next steps in my life. For context, I'm 30 years old with an MPH and living back at home with my family since I quit my job in January doing grants and contracts. Long story short, when I started college I wanted to become a doctor and ended up doubting my skills and didn't want to study for 10+ years so switched to public health. I was interested in health and business so wanted to combine both. HOWEVER, at the time I also was still thinking maybe PA school but developed an eating disorder and that took away from my mind and critical thinking skills. So I ended up getting an MPH. My first job I hated and shadowed PAs, nurses and for some reason just decided to see if maybe doing something else would help. Fast forward 7 years later, I quit my job since it was making me suicidal. I still struggle with severe depression and decision fatigue.

What I do know is I love talking to people and want to feel challenged in my job. I do need something a little flexible since too much stress may cause me to flare (I have a chronic illness as well). I don't know if it makes sense to switch to UX design/Research in this market, stick to hating my jobs in public health, or go down the nursing route. I do want to make more money as well, but just not be so miserable while doing it. I am all over the place hah. It's been 7 months of living back at home now and I am slwoly feeling like a failure and regret so many life choices. I keep getting overwhelmed with options and think of so many things I could do, but end up doing nothing and the cycle continues. ah decisions fatigue.

It's 9 pm on a Thursday…

 I hear the beep of another email hitting my phone…

 My chest tightens, my pulse begins to race and my mind begins to wonder…

 Is that email for me? Maybe it's an emergency and they really need me.

 I opened my phone only to find that the email wasn’t addressed to me but I was copied.

 

But wait….

 I know the answer. I can help.

 And so it begins.

 I hop on my laptop, log in, and start working.

 

**Now…**

* My bedtime routine is broken.
* I'll probably spend another hour or two trying to stop thinking about work.
* I'll probably not get the restful sleep that I need to be productive the next day.

 

This was my life back in 2016.

* I didn't set boundaries.
* I tried to be the everything guy.
* I didn't take care of my own well-being.

 

And I suffered greatly from it.

 

It took me a long time to realize a lot of the stress that existed in my life was caused by my own drive and not understanding what was important to me and what goals I really wanted to accomplish.

 

I let everyone else's goals be my goals.

I let everyone else's expectations (or my perception of them) be my expectations.

 

**It took a lot of personal work and deep insight into myself to climb out of that hole I had created. I spent many years trying to understand myself better, what was happening to me, what I really wanted, and what boundaries I needed.**

 

I didn't have a guide.

I didn't know who to talk to about this.

 

**So I’m posting here today to remind you that you have control over your life. You can make the change necessary to live how YOU want to live.**

 

And also one very important thing….

 

**more**

 

There are people, resources, and groups that can help you realize how you are living is not going to serve you in the long run and can actually be shortening your life.

 

Coaches, therapists, support groups—they are all there for you. This is what I wish I knew then.

 

So make sure you take care of yourself and do things for you.

1esev4o,careeradvice,Sabotaged By My Boss. What do I do?,"I’m from Toronto Ontario and have been with the company for 9years, working in retail sales. I'm a team lead and need some advice from more experienced managers. Detailed story:

I was recently given my first (&final) warning by my manager (Let’s call him Bob)for breaking company policy which I was given permission to do from my manager’s boss (let’s call him Billy)

The company policy states that we cannot ring in our own sales at retail locations. We need a managers consent. I wanted to buy an item from our store but Bob was on vacation. Due to Bob being on vacation, I had to go to Billy to get permission to ring out the sale. Billy granted me permission and said it wasn't an issue and to go ahead with it. 

Keep in mind all of our bonuses are based on sales and meeting quotas. This sale went to me with Billy’s approval. 

When Bob gets back from vacation, all is fine. He knows that Billy had given me approval for the sale of my own purchase. It wasn’t until a few days later when Bob found out the amount of the sale that things changed. Suddenly he was on the attack accusing me of breaking company policy and told me I would be written up. I was immediately on the defensive due to confusion and didn't know what to say or do. I told him that Billy had given me permission but Bob denied it. He then proceeds to go to the back and call Billy. He comes back out after 15minutes and has Billy on the phone. I asked Billy why I was being written up when he had given me permission to ring up my own sale. Billy was silent and didn't come to my defense. I was shocked someone would do this. (note: I was given permission via phone call so I had nothing in writing)

That's when I went into work the following day and got called into Bob’s office. I was given my first ever warning and it was noted that it was also my final warning.  

I was told I have until Monday to sign the papers. And that I was losing my monthly bonus because of this. 

Background on the workplace: company culture at this retail location has always been lax. Company policy states no one can ring out their own items but Bob has given everyone his code to ring out their items. Everyone does this and this is the norm. I have NEVER participated in this and have only ever done so with Bob’s (or Billy’s) approval. 

Bob constantly breaks the rules so I assumed it was the norm. Bob pockets company money from cash sales and makes personal purchases with the money. (food etc)

Bob is also known to participate in time theft for his friends that work under him. They often leave work hours early but are still on the clock as per Bob. 

Bob is given an allowance for staff entertainment as well as supplies for the retail location. Bob has been using the pocketed cash to pay for these things as well so the books look like his expenses are low. Which in turn ends up giving Bob a larger bonus. 

I have worked for the company for 9 years with no issues. This is the first time anything has ever come up and it's due to what I think is Bob's greed. He was upset that he did not collect a bonus on the sale that I rang out. 

I have feeling Billy knows Bob does these things but says nothing. For example, during a staff dinner during a good month, Billy saw that Bob used the cash from cash sales to buy drinks for them and said “I see nothing, I hear nothing”. 



What do I do? Do I sign the papers? Do I write an email and explain everything to Bob, Billy & maybe even cc Billy’s boss?

This isn't right. But I don't know what to do. 

Edit: I've never been in trouble before. I have been anxious and stressed since this event occurred and haven't been properly sleeping. 

The same thing I was written up for is still happening amongst co-workers and Bob has not said anything. ",2024-08-14 22:35:13,3,4,1,Positive,0.12177318295739348,0,0,2

1atz80w,stress,Chronic Stress or a GI Issue? Both?,"(Throwaway, don't want this on my main) Some background context- I'm a freshman in college majoring in technical theatre, and have been working in this industry since my sophomore year of high school. Much of the last three years have involved consecutive late nights, juggling multiple responsibilities from doing shows (on top of typical school/life stressors), and the hard physical work it entails as well. Last year (senior year) I was pretty much constantly under stress from September-June. I'm enjoying being in college, but it is still quite rigorous. I've done my best to take care of myself, but I'm not perfect and do push myself at times.  
During my last week of school mid-December (final projects, working too much and sleeping too little, aka very stressful week), I hit what I thought was burnout. I was exhausted, not hungry, felt kinda queasy, and just not great. However, this did not go away. Since then, in varying degrees of severity and very inconsistently, I've had the following symptoms:  
	\- Queasiness  
	\- Abnormally fatigued, sometimes comes on suddenly at night  
	\- Loss of appetite  
	\- Digestion feeling off (stomach being noisy, occasional constipation)  
	\- Hard to describe, but just feeling not great. I can tell something is off  
I also sometimes have trouble falling asleep, but that's not new and I take melatonin which helps. I saw a doctor recently and am on an antacid, which has eliminated the queasiness, and a fiber powder, but I still feel off sometimes. All my blood work was normal.   
Could this be caused by having such a long-term stressful lifestyle? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",2024-02-18 17:18:33,1,3,1,Positive,0.00867526617526618,0,0,2
1es6kkt,careeradvice,Am I crazy for wanting to become a full-time student again? Or am I overthinking this?,"**TLDR:**

I’m a 2022 marketing grad currently working as a recruiter, unhappy with my day to day and my income. I am desperate to make a career change that would likely require a different bachelors degree (comp sci or engineering). My experience in recruiting has exposed me to just how critical management can be in regard to things like an employment gap or short tenure in a position, so I am worried that leaving my job to pursue said degree will only make my background look worse and that it will be a decision I am made to regret- my job experience is limited to an 8 month recruiting job, followed by a year gap, and then my current recruiting job of 5 months. 

Would I be crazy to leave my job and pursue this degree, even if it means abandoning my half way complete MBA and having no work experience for another few years? Or is it not too late to effectively start over?

**Full context:**



I graduated in 2022 with a BS in Marketing and could not find a marketing job in any capacity. After 2 months of applications, I took a job in recruiting planning to keep searching. I  did well there and received promotions, but never enjoyed recruiting or my compensation in the slightest. I stayed in that role for 8 months. 

I left that recruiting job after getting accepted to a 2 year MBA program and spent just under a year pursuing that before accepting my current job, which is a hybrid marketing/recruiting role for a an engineering company. I settled on this position due to once again failing to land interviews, and while it is less recruiting than my previous role, I am still unhappy as recruiting takes up the bulk of my time. I have also learned marketing isn’t as enjoyable as I once thought it was. 

I have now been in this role for 5 months and have since paused my MBA. I did this because I not only found it difficult to balance my work, personal, and school life but also because I realized a career in management, particularly in the context of marketing or recruiting, does not align with my career or personal goals in any capacity. 

After continually failing to get interviews and transition away from recruiting, I have now reached a point of desperation where I feel the need to make a career change. I have spoken with friends and peers, taken many of the career guidance tests, and have determined I am most interested in an engineering or computer science role- roles that require me to complete another bachelor degree. 

I would like to dedicate my time to one of these degrees, leaving my current job to become a full-time student, but my limited time in recruiting has exposed me to perspectives from different management levels across an abundance of different companies. I fear that my butchered and inconsistent experience will make it difficult for me to land a decent well paying role all over again.

189tc8g,stress,Scary symptoms..,"Last Sunday I had a massive panic attack & for a moment I honestly thought it was a heart attack.. I suffer pretty badly from heart anxiety but I find it so scary that my anxiety mimics heart attack symptoms! I have chest pain that radiates down my left arm mainly on/off.. I hate my job, currently moving house, my dog is getting old, my Grandma is near death so I am very stressed.. BUT is it really possible that anxiety can cause me to feel the symptoms so scary that make me feel like I’m having a heart attack? I assume with a heart attack the symptoms wouldn’t come & go so I’m pretty sure this is anxiety related, I also had my heart checked a few months ago which came back fine. I just find it incredibly scary with the symptoms that I feel because they are so closely linked to a heart attack.. Advice needed please?😞",2023-12-03 13:19:05,4,4,1,Negative,-0.05821759259259258,0,0,0
1e9cd31,stress,How to Manage Stress at 19? Tips Needed,"

Hi everyone,

Recently, I've been experiencing quite a bit of stress without any apparent reason. It's not that I feel overwhelmed, but I have this constant strange sensation of energy. I'm 19 years old, weigh 183 pounds, and have some muscle since I've been going to the gym for a few months now.

During my night shifts, my heart rate ranges between 105-120 BPM. The job is pretty active, as I have to be on my feet and walking around for the entire 8 hours. The work environment isn't great, but it's not stressful enough to be the sole cause. I used to have pretty severe insomnia, but it has improved significantly since I started eating better (mainly chicken and salad).

I asked ChatGPT for advice, and it suggested I see a doctor, but that would mean missing work. It reassures me to know that at my age, I can handle some pressure and that going to the gym keeps me in better shape compared to others my age who might be doing drugs or partying.

Should I be worried about this situation, or is it just a normal part of adult life that I need to accept? I appreciate any opinions or advice you might have.

Thanks a lot.",2024-07-22 11:53:42,1,2,1,Positive,0.08087121212121212,0,0,2
1dbatb8,stress,Extreme fatigue and exhaustion?,"Hello, everyone! I'm a 26F and I'm experiencing some sort of exhaustion to the point where I can't do basic tasks anymore. I'm struggling to get up from my bed, to be honest. I feel so dizzy and tired, that everyday I'm dragging myself to even eat.

I'm experiencing perhaps one of the stressful periods of my life. I have several other health issues that have been flaring up really badly (mostly my migraines and joint pain), my relationship ended after almost 6 years, I am alone in a very noisy place where I am unable to even relax or sleep properly. I'm not doing well, at all. 

I have never been this tired in my life and I'm not sure if this is ""normal"". Has something like this ever happened to anyone else? Is it possible for stress to simply make you this exhausted?

1do273l,stress,How to identify chronic stress?,"Been having digestive issues for awhile now (>6 months) and tests (scan, colonoscopy) didn't really identify any culprit. They did discover some diverticula (unusual for my age) but the doc considered it to be a consequence rather than a cause for my issues. 

Ever since I've been trying by myself to find the cause, keeping a food journal, upping fiber and doing more exercise but sadly, to no avail. Lately I've been considering whether it might be stress-related. I have been self employed for a couple of years now and there is always a level of uncertainty involved with that. I do find myself to occasionally struggle with patience, a feeling of restlessness and difficult to cut off. 

I haven't had a vacation in years and there are days where I feel like my brain battery is empty but overall I did never really consider it as abnormal, nor do I have a strong urge to take a vacation. Lately I also noticed unconscious jaw clenching especially at night. I do usually fall asleep fast and sleep through but I do have the feeling of sleeping with tension as I do tend to have a stiff neck or back when I wake up. 

So I guess my question is, how do I know if there is an abnormal level of chronic stress. Are there certain routines I could try to assess improvements over a prolonged period. I was considering to take an ashwaganda supplement since I've heard positive things about it. 

Any ideas are welcome!",2024-06-25 09:51:25,2,7,1,Positive,0.07303030303030303,0,0,2

1em60ws,careeradvice,"Asked for a raise, they told me prepare a proposal & we will discuss it in the meeting. I have social anxiety. I'm thinking of pulling back my request. ","So, every one in my team is getting paid  X amount which is twice of what I am getting paid. And I have been here for 8 months now. 

Everyone started their contracts with X amount but they started my contract with Y amount half of X. I got to know that after I joined. Though my workload was less that time. Not quite half though more than that. 

But after three months they told me they expect me to contribute more and ofcourse they will  increase my pay as well and I said sure. And in the next couple of months I started working more almost catching upto the current members. 

First, you will have to know where I am coming from. 

I have got depression and some serious social anxiety and I feel like maybe I am a pushover sometimes and people just take advantage of me. So I m very sceptical. 

I wasn't even sure I was fit to work but landed a remote gig anyways. I love my team. I like the work. It's something I can do. I even received positive feedback on my progress on multiple occasions. 

I just always felt like 'less' somehow. I know I'm not the best on my team and sometimes I struggle with the deadlines. It's difficult when somedays you just don't want to wake up to another horrific meaningless day and cry your eyes out and struggle to justify your self worth. I have thought of quitting a lot. The reason I haven't quit is probably because it's such a pain to tell them and explain this face to face. (I haven't told them about any of my personal struggles). 

I can also ghost them and block them but man that's jus pathetic so I stick to it. Some days are better than others. 

But I have a team and I feel responsible and I want to keep my promise. I get very nervous between people and groups. My thoughts get all jumbled. And I constantly freak out incase I embrass myself.(&,i have a lot, though nobody talks about it.) 

Last month two new members joined and they started with X amount too and double my work load and I thought it's finally time I tell them I can do this too. 

I want them to treat me as an equal. I mean if even new members are getting paid more than me something must be wrong with me. 

I just told them. Told em I want a raise after some immense internal struggle. I jus want to get treated fairly. 

Heck it's not even about the money I just want to feel like I matter in this team and that what I do means something. I volunteer when something new comes up, i go out of my way to look for solutions. I try okay. I try. 

So when I heard that they want to specially prepare for a meeting to discuss my raise i freaked out. I can't do meetings I barely hold up on daily brief meetings and it's so stressful to do them and one focused on me is where people would dicuss me. 

Idk it makes me look like I have asked for something I wasn't supposed to and now I will judged whether I'm worthy or not. 

I'm thinking of just texting my senior that it's cool.
 I don't feel like getting a raise anymore or that I'm not ready. I don't want to this. I'm not sure. Please help. ",2024-08-07 07:54:00,2,2,1,Positive,0.08563169286853496,1,0,2

1erwb5k,careeradvice,32M feeling lost in life and career,"I am a 32 years old unmarried, childless man and I am currently feeling lost in life and career. Therefore, and facing some embarrassment at first, I picked up the courage to seek professional support from a therapist for the first time in my life. Nonetheless, I've decided to post here in order to get additional advice from men and women who are part of this community.

I think that my current feeling of being lost (or left behind) in life mainly stems from two circumstances: mild bullying which resulted in the inability to fully experience my teenage years if and when I compare them with the ones experienced by my peers and the loss of my father due to cancer when Covid-19 was ravaging in 2020. The first circumstance, in fact, turned me from a quite extroverted and carefree boy into an introverted, overthinking and resentful man while the second one wreaked havoc in my everyday life as I abruptly lost one of the most important people I was attached to in a phase in which everyone is supposed to settle down both personally and professionally. Cancer is basically like having to deal with a time bomb where you cannot see the timer and this puts you face to face with the precariousness of life.

Those events profoundly affected me, as I practically spent my teenage years most of the time alone focusing on my studies and these last years trying to settle down professionally facing great difficulties in both dealing with people (as I work in Sales & Distribution) and life itself. Career-wise, there are days in which I feel completely absorbed by what I am doing and therefore I manage to get things done as expected without having to deal with what my therapist calls ""intrusive thoughts"" and others in which I feel overwhelmed by a hurricane of negative thoughts and sensations about myself and the future ahead of me that make me cry silently on my pillow as soon as I get home at the end of the day. The sales-related job I am currently holding, paired with the psychological status I'm confronting lately, can be really challenging as it's basically all about constant interaction with existing / prospective clients and bringing in results for the company. You and your team are at the forefront of the company and partly responsible for its annual turnover, therefore you are subject to both internal and external pressure as far as targets, margins and the like are taken into account by superiors and management.

I deeply regret the fact of not having been able to experience love in its blossoming, intense and raw nature during my teenage years, unlike my peers, the fact that those times and hangouts will never come back again thus leaving a deep scar inside my heart and lastly, the fact that I am very often going to be at unease in social settings when acquaintances/colleagues/clients/prospects etc. discuss about their family, children and career prospects. At the same time I also drastically reduced the amount of time I spend on social media as people just seem to share the good things in their lives, but I always try to take any opportunity to hang around my friends and family members, even if some of them are starting a family and this makes me feel at unease as I previously explained. Going out for dinner/ a movie/ a play at the theatre all by myself is too much for me to handle and, quite frankly, humiliating at the moment. Casually going out for some drinks or travelling instead, are more manageable activities but come with some strain as well.

Sometimes I take into account the option of a career change into less people-oriented positions like the ones in IT for example, but I don't feel skilled or driven enough to restart everything from scratch... I'd like to become more optimistic and resilient in order not to find myself alone and hopeless as I reach maturity and retirement. Are there career coaches or people holding sales, HR or management positions who could give me some advice? Thank you for your help and please forgive me if I made some mistakes but I am not a native English speaker.",2024-08-14 08:26:48,2,2,1,Positive,0.09432057475535736,0,0,2
1es10xa,college,Unsure about returning to college while working full time—Need advice ,"I'm in need of some advice on what I should do here. A few years ago, I dropped out of college due to mental health issues and haven't returned since. I currently work as a custodian at the college I used to attend, and the building I clean houses the president's office. I see the president regularly, and he always asks when I’m going to return to school, offering to help if I need it.

One day, I decided to explore the possibility of going back, so I talked to him. He connected me with a couple of people from administration. Initially, they told me that in order to reapply, I would need to clear the balance I owed. When I mentioned this to the president, he requested to have the balance cleared for me, which is huge, and I know I'm really fortunate.

Now, I'm waiting on FAFSA to see if I can get any grants, but I'm worried. I need to maintain a job and make at least $1,600 a month. I'm thinking about going to school part-time, but I'm still unsure, especially since the job market isn't great where I live. I'm really debating whether I can manage going back to school or not.

I (27f) have been with my current company for three years in September. Before this job, I was with another company for one year and gained some experience for my current job. I also obtained my master’s degree prior to these jobs. I started at my current company making 40k, which felt very low and I tried negotiating but ultimately accepted because of my goals. We are supposed to have annual reviews, and I have only received one, which was 1.5 years into the job. I received a 9k raise. This past May I received a 1k raise putting me at 50k. Without getting into too many details about my job, I have taken over many roles and have gotten various certifications, as well as created a new source of revenue for the company. It is extremely stressful and I feel overwhelmed everyday. I have already felt I deserved a raise, and then I found out two of my coworkers, who do less than I do and just started last year right out of college, had starting salaries of 54k and 56k. They both just received 2k raises as well. To make things worse, another coworker recently changed positions to do somewhat similar work as I do, and he went from hourly to salary of 65k. He’s only been here two months longer than I have. I feel extremely embarrassed and disheartened. I have no motivation anymore. 

I was told I should wait until my start date anniversary and ask to have an annual review, but I don’t know if I can hold it in. Do I wait? Should I bring up the pay differentials? Do I ask to make 65k? Do I just look for a different job? They don’t have anyone to do what I do and I know it would seriously hurt the company. Thank you for any advice.

Go to graduate school I starred a few years ago. I have an assignment due in a few hours and I'm just straight up stuck. I ended up with pets I don't even want that I need to take care of. I've got people in my life who need me, always need some sort of help or comfort and I'm not even good at comforting people. I'm in debt and every time I seem to pay something off something else happens and I'm strapped for cash again. Just switched medical insurances and have to deal with deductibles for the first time (I don't know how everyone else does it) and now I've got massive medical bills just from a single er visit that I don't know how to pay. My lawn is a mess and so is the house because most of my time goes to work and school. I could drop from school but I've only got 2 more years to go, would seem like a huge waste. I never finish any of my personal projects. I barely have time to sit and relax, I get about 2 hours a day for down time, maybe. I have trouble sleeping so I'm always tired. I'm trying to make friends online because of the convenience but people online are so fickle, one has gotten close but now I barely have time to chat with. I feel like I'm drowning here, I'm usually so positive or at least not worried but years of suppression have put me in a place where I don't know how to cope anymore.

I get a lot of hot flushes often when I’m in bed. I cant breathe a lot of the time as my chest feels too tight and it feels like breathing isn’t doing anything (if that makes sense.) I often feel like im gonna throw up, but i never do except from back in December 2023 but im 99% that was norovirus, i get panic attacks frequently however they spike more in school holidays and during the night. I honestly dont remember the last time i maneged to get a good night of sleep. I get so annoyed at everything and that often results in me taking it out on other people, which makes me feel like absolute shit. I get a lot of health anxiety so i worry this is more than just stress but i don’t know.  I sometimes get sharp pains in random places in my body but often my chest and arms. I understand this may be hormones, but either way i cant cope with it anymore, each day i feel less and less motivated to live. I cant cope, is anyone else going through this and of so, what can i do to help? Thank you for reading.

The two most common stressors; time and money. And I feel like I’m dealing with both of them. I’m so behind on my utilities, i started a debt settlement the beginning of the year so that’s helped some but I also got into a situation where I needed to take a few payday loans out to get things paid but now those payments are catching up to me and my account keeps going negative so when I do get paid I feel like I lose half the paycheck to that. I already work 45+ a week, I’m salary so no overtime sadly. And I can’t get a part time job due to the lack of time and I’d have to spend more money on daycare just to make that happen. The stress is literally affecting my mood and sleep 😴 so that doesn’t help 
I’ve always been the type to not ask for help (and I still refuse because I got myself in this mess and I’ll get myself out!) it just feels nice being able to basically say this out loud and give my mind a breather.

I had an American professor as my thesis advisor, who has been utmost supportive throughout the whole process, for which I am extremely grateful. We talked a lot, even about personal experiences because I was suffering from immense anxiety and he tried to help me through the struggles. He was always there to talk, and he’s been also  praying for me as he happens to be a lutheran pastor as well.

After my defense he hugged me, told me to stay in touch and asked me if he can text me sometimes in the future. I said yes and I meant it, because I like him as a person and I’m sure that it would help me to have him as a mentor or something in my life. He introduced me to his wife as well, who was really kind to me. She said that her husband had told her a lot about me so she would like to hear from me in the future, and that they are willing to help me with anything if I needed.

However I’m not sure what they meant exactly or what they are expecting from me to do. I’m Eastern European so I’m not that familiar with American culture and I’ve never had any other teachers in my life who have been this close to me. So, what do you think?

Relaxation and Progress 

""Write a diary entry of your day and then relax for 10 minds, try to have as less thoughts as possible. You could try a relaxing shower or just sit for 10 minds.
Then let's take the first step towards our micro goal today.""

Relaxation techniques such as mindfulness and deep breathing reduce stress by decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity, leading to lower cortisol levels and improved mood regulation. Achieving personal goals boosts dopamine, enhancing pleasure and motivation, which encourages ongoing healthy behaviors. Neuroplastic changes from these practices improve cognitive function and emotional regulation.

Empirical research supports these effects. For instance, relaxation techniques have been shown to alleviate anxiety and depression symptoms, and personal progress has been linked with increased well-being. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) incorporate these elements to effectively improve mental health outcomes by enhancing self-efficacy and managing stress.",2024-04-30 19:45:55,1,1,1,Positive,0.09888888888888887,0,0,2
1833lzc,stress,Chronic pain(s) from chronic anxiety,"For the past few months, I’ve been dealing with chronic pain that seems to move around my body, primarily in my feet—especially the heels—and deep buttocks pain that feels like it's within the bones. They sometimes switch. Almost never at the same time. 

I’ve undergone numerous doctor visits, countless blood tests, and several scans, yet everything seems to check out okay health-wise. A physical therapist ruled out fibromyalgia but suggested that the pain might be linked to chronic stress and anxiety.

Adding to this, I've been grappling with intense fatigue (not sleepiness) sporadically, which complicates things further.

This has been an incredibly challenging journey, especially because the pain persists and impacts my daily life, making it difficult to walk at times. It's become evident that it's not just physical; it's linked to my mental health. HOWEVER, I have dealt well with my anxiety and do not have almost any anxiety feelings or symptomts for months now. If anything, the pains started after my month long anxiety flare up.

I’m curious if anyone here has experienced something similar—chronic pain seemingly from chronic anxiety or stress—and if so, how did you cope? Did you find any strategies that helped alleviate the pain or manage it better over time? How long did it take and where were the pains exactly in your body ?

This has been me my entire life always striving to take care of, and make others happy, and to laugh. This last year and a half has been te worst in my almost 50yrs on this planet. First in July of '22 I had to resign from my job of 10 yrs due to political differences in my local government job after a change in director.  Keep in mind i was a 911 operator for 10yrs which is stressful all the time. I came home told my boyfriend that I left my job, and he took off. After I had his back for months while he found a new job supporting him financially for those months. A month and a half after leaving KY job my 28 yr old son lost his battle with addiction accidentally overdosing because he got high and took his sleeping medicationon top of it. Due to leaving my job I no longer had death insurance on him, and had to pay for everything alone.  His father did not give me a dime nor did he help with planning or participate, or lift a finger in anyway.  While awaiting his autopsy, and return of his remains my father got diagnosed with lung cancer. He never smoked, but was a fire fighter in the 70's and 80's. I was so afraid that I would lose him too that I avoided him. I felt like the worst daughter in the world, and my father is my person, and I let him down. I had never seen my father sick ever except when he had back surgery which caused him to retire on disability years earlier. 2 days after my son passed my youngest son was in an accident. He wasn't injured, but it just added to the stress pile that was already a mile high. At my son's memorial my mother made everything about her, argued with the Pastor, and blamed me publicly for his death to multiple people. Not once did my mother ask me how I was feeling or if I was ok. Needless to say we no longer speak I cut her off after 2 straight months of belligerent text messages and berating phone calls. During all this I had to find another job, and participate in job interviews. The new job took off to a really rocky start and didn't help my depression. Several co-workers gave me a hard time because they hated the agency i came from. Riding me for months, after I logged a complaint with upper management it finally stopped. A year and 3 months later and I'm just starting to feel somewhat normal. By no mean am I over it, just dealing, and processing it a bit better.

16x3g0i,stress,Stress at new work and histery about making a mistake,"Aloha everyone

I feel like a lot of people deal with work stress throughout the wowking days (and possibly lots of u on your off days as well) and that it almost feels like a routine, or at least something that crosses your mind before arriving at work, so I was hoping that some of you could share your ways of coping with this mental monster and energy vampire.

I'm having a new job which I've started 15 days ago (after 15 days of training course). I'm working on a reception for a very first time as I didn't study for it nor have any previous experience and I have an abnormal fear of making a mistake - let me explain. My job doesn't include only reception as itself, but also the restaurant part (from taking care of the documentation to taking care of their money, contracts, scanning the papers, writing mails, communicating for all their needs with suppliers and informing them on all of that) and documentation of all sorts (which includes housekeeping on the side with reception and restaurant as well, water company, sanitary inspection...). I also take care of catering that our restaurant does, as we are the only mediators between those airlines and the restaurant. I also have the obligation to inform our superios on other sector's shifts, how their work's going etcetc. That's a lot of fucking information and beleve me when i say that even if you write it all down, you cannot possibly find what you need in that moment when you need it, especially not when there are guests waiting to check in, waiter coming to our reception for the exchange of money and our company's driver looking over guests' shoulder, reminding me that he needs things done for him at the very same moment (and there are couple of actions happening at the same time almost the whole shift)

The biggest problem in all of this is that I know its impossible to avoid mistakes. The very head of the reception (whos got 10years working experience and college for this very profession) admitted to me that even after all these times she makes mistakes and that its completely normal, BUT when it comes to MY mistakes, i have to listen about it from 3 different people, read about it in our group chat and then read about it in our receptionist's book as well. I guilt trip myself even harder after that even though I know that It's a fresh start for me and that I shouldn't be hard on myself, I still find myself dreaming about my work, having unconcious thoughts of it and talking about it too much. 

So I'm asking for the help one more time, It would mean a lot.",2023-10-01 14:59:51,2,1,1,Negative,-0.016797438672438676,0,0,0

Furthermore, I am concerned about the admission process as I consider myself an average student with no extracurricular activities or internships. I have another year to improve in this regard. Seeking advice from people around me has left me feeling even more confused. Some suggest that attending university in Bangladesh would be comfortable and stress free given my parents are there, and then pursuing a master's or PhD abroad, while others believe that it's not a good idea to regress to Bangladesh, and I should move forward to countries like the UK, Canada, or Australia. With conflicting advice, I am unsure of what to do. I have a year to make my final decision.

1docv3f,stress,Tips to cope with chronic stress? ,"My job is overwhelming and lately I have been stuck in a functional freeze shortly after I arrive. It feels like every task I complete generates 5 more. My boss is very dependent on me knowing what and how to do things so I function with very little oversight. 

We semi-recently added an additional employee who needs a lot of oversight and hand-holding. It takes them far too long to finish tasks and they frequently forget how to do things. I’ve mentioned how overwhelmed I am to my boss and she just tells me to give work to others. This requires me to stop and take even more time to explain how to do it because the new-ish employee forgot. Our front office has several procedures in place (like designated scanning/file clerk) but my boss forgets or ignores our system which leads to things getting messed up by the newbie or missed. 

I am on summer from school right now and am supposed to be studying for a licensing exam and writing a 10,000 word thesis paper. I can’t even take a lunch break to work on it without feeling completely overwhelmed by work. I’m not sure how I’m going by to balance three nights of classes and preparing for the actual licensing exam with work next year. 

I haven’t been able to stick to a diet plan because of stress eating while I’m mentally checked out so I keep gaining weight which messes with my psyche even more. I’ve been trying to squeeze in light workouts but they don’t feel like I’m doing enough. Sitting at a desk 8-5 on work days and bouncing from desk to car to desk from 8am -11:30 pm definitely feels demoralizing.

1cuhux0,academia,Am I shooting myself in the foot with my program?,"So I'm currently attending a PhD program overseas. The country I'm in has some strange requirements where PhDs must already obtain a masters in order to start a PhD. They require a lot of extra coursework in PhD on top of everything you take in your masters. Anyway I'm wondering if I'm shooting myself in the foot doing my PhD here.

Basically I'm a research psychologist but there were no psychology programs available here in English. I can't speak the local language fluenty but a local professor of psychology reccomended that I take a local regional studies program that allowed me to conduct research in psychology (my focus is on social and political psychology). My supervisor is a media psychologist but my degree will be in Asian Studies. I moved here to marry my wife who is a local, however I'd like to eventually move back to the United States. 


Would it still be possible to find post doc roles in psychology with an Asian studies degree? Would having a foreign degree hurt me a lot ? (The school is considered the top school for social science within the country). I also obtained my masters degree overseas (in the UK). Recently I've been hearing from other students that having the foreign degree might be a big problem for finding work which worries me. 

Does anyone have experience with something like this? I'm worried that 1. Having a foreign PhD might be a problem and 2. That having a non psych PhD will prevent me from working in a psych discipline (I don't want to get stuck in political science as I really love psychology)

1e9qcau,stress,Anxiety and the Subconscious: The Tiger in the Dark,"Hello everyone! For those who don't know me, I am a clinical hypnotherapist, Director of a remote practice and live my life with ADHD and GAD. Through my own personal experiences and those working with others with similar issues for the past several years, I'd like to share some things with you all today. I need to emphasize that, as a hypnotherapist, I am not working directly with issues like anxiety, ADHD or any other diagnosed condition. My work is more behavioral, teaching about the mind's functions we were never shown and helping to create growth, change and wellness. 

Ok, so having anxiety sucks. I don't love it. When asked what it was like, I once told a friend that it felt like I was being *casually* hunted for sport. In fact, I didn't even realize I was feeling anxiety until I finally received a diagnosis and medication; the silence was almost deafening. I realized this wasn't a fix, but an opportunity to address and help myself without that lingering, low-grade fear. Before anything else, let me please encourage everyone to seek medical assistance if you think it will help you.

Anxiety is such a strange thing. It's a good thing, in reality. It is a subconscious response that exists to keep you alive, safe from lions and tigers and bears. It's there for survival. Now, that said... a project due or an upcoming social event is not a life-or-death event worthy of existential fear. Yet, it feels like it, doesn't it? Your subconscious: more specifically your primitive mind, your reactionary lizard brain that lies below even your subconscious, cannot tell the difference between these events. This is often why, at least speaking for myself, I would feel so guilty about my anxiety: I wouldn't give myself permission to feel what I was feeling because it seemed like I was 'overreacting'. That phone call isn't a wolf in the darkness, after all.

Simply giving yourself permission to feel what you feel is a big step. Emotions and reactions don't require validation, they exist. Sometimes they do merit examination, but to examine we must allow it to be present. On that same note, a feeling goes beyond an emotion. When we stop to consider our anxiety, it always comes with a physical feeling, doesn't it? Mine felt like a ball of ice in the bottom of my stomach. What does your feel like?   
  
This is an important question because it leads me to something I'd like everyone to try the next time you struggle with feelings of anxiety. Examine how you feel physically and give it a description. A quality and a form. Where is it in your body? Imagine these feelings as a thing inside or around you. Now for the fun part... how would you resolve that thing? For example, my ice ball. The solution would be to melt it away, so this is what I visualize. Breathing slowly, calmly and deeply, I focus on that image of the ball of ice and see it melt away... and I feel better.

*Why does this work?* Because imagery is the language of your subconscious; by solidifying this feeling of anxiety into an image and manipulating it, you are speaking to your subconscious and letting it know that the feeling is received and understood but not needed. While this will not prevent feelings of anxiety from arising, it is a useful tool for addressing it when they arise. In fact, this is a tool I use in my own life.

So, let me know because I'm always curious... what do your anxious thoughts *feel* like?",2024-07-22 21:41:56,3,9,1,Positive,0.08231060606060606,0,0,2

1cwpg21,stress,I could be laid off soon which has been leading to panic and anxiety attacks since Friday,"Hi all, I just need to get it out of me and ask for help as I don't know what to do.

I've been working as a consultant in a mid-size boutique consultancy, delivering really high quality stuff for clients. I've always received positive feedback from my clients to the point where one wanted to poach me. Our company then got bought by a massive organisation some time ago, we got TUPEd a couple of months ago and we've only started recently integrating with the big org. I finished a client engagement 1.5 weeks ago and was trying to catch up on admin stuff like understanding new processes, learning goals, profile updates, goals for the year. Friday afternoon rolls on and we all get a non-personal email from the PA of the head of our business unit. The email basically states there's now a 60-day bench (when one isn't billable) policy after which there's a formal HR consultation. I've now got 48 calendar days to find a project with no support available, no network built up (as most senior people from my old company either left or were forced to quit), niche skillset that is hard to sell and no knowledge of how to gain an access to projects. Whilst I've been trying to reach out to people, making my name known and visible wherever I can, I feel lost, hopeless and on my own with me potentially getting laid off in 2.5 months.

My partner and I have had an offer accepted and mortgage approved on a house recently. My mum also lost her job a couple of weeks ago, meaning I'll have to support my parents financially so that they don't become homeless if her temporary job doesn't work out. The job market is really bad in my discipline, with literally no jobs around. If I loose my job now, I'll have to dip into my savings for most likely a couple of months which would set me back by a couple of years professionally and would almost guarantee getting a house will now be only a dream. All things combined, I've been having panic and anxiety attacks since Friday. I'm not getting any meaningful amount of sleep, I keep shaking and trembling, I constantly feel sick and have no appetite. I have to have a poker face to my partner and my parents as I don't even know how to tell them that all the dreams and plans might get shattered soon.I have a counselling session with a therapist on Thursday as I know I need help.

So since then even after taking the proper dosage of anti allergic medicines and flu medicines. I feel like i have like a bubble at the back of my throat which i keep on trying to push down by swallowing mucus. I also feel like i cant breathe if there isn’t good air flow around me. As soon as i hit the pillow flat or raised i start feeling some kind of nasal dripping in the back of my throat and i start trying to swallow mucus hoping it would clear out. Its is constant till i start doing something like reading but it can take sometimes up to two hours before i cant sleep. I also take melatonin 1.5mg which makes me sleepy and even if i sleep i wake up. I also thought its sleep apnea but the doctors say it’s not. After revisiting the ER three times, one doctor said its psychological and spoke to a psychiatrist who prescribed me Tab Cipralez 10 mg One tablet after breakfast, Cap Lyrica 75 mg if necessary. I was worried to start with the cipralez but now i cant take it any more, the constant urge to swallow the mucus the suffocation is killing me and making everything worse i was hoping if someone has been through this and could share their story.

My situation is rather unique for a variety of reasons. All of the insane nonsense which has occurred over the past decade has led me to this situation. I worked hard and very strategically to get me to the spot I was at two months ago, before FAFSA decided to fuck about.

I'm currently working with an outside state-funded agency to clear the difference between Federal contribution and tuition. Without the Award Letter detailing the exact amount provided by Federal Financial Aid, I'm unable to give the State agency the information they need to help me.

I am LOSING MY MIND. It's pretty difficult to get me ""riled up"" like this, but here I am .. Absolutely inconsolable.

1ert1up,careeradvice,"Is it worth taking a $17,000 pay cut for some sanity?","hi all,

I am currently working as a production manager handling 6 different brands at my company. Im bascially in charge of ensuring 1.4 million units are being shipped on time. I have some support but she is only helping me for 4 of the brands which equates to 600,000 of those units.

I have a lot of stress, and late-night calls 3 times a week with the factories. My salary is 87K, which is the average range for a production manager in apparel.

I've been in production for 5 years now, but have noticed a pattern of late work hours with insignificant pay. Very high turnover as well. And the grunt of the work always pushed to me.

I am already so tired and stressed from this field of work. I broke last week because of it was so hectic. I found out my only help will be going on maternity leave in a few months and I have not been provided a temp. They told me there are data entry associates I can use to support me in the meantime. (this is mostly for PO updates etc.).

Anyway, I broke and talked to my manager and told her i want to apply to an open role as a supply chain planning analyst. I had talked to the planning team about the new role and they mentioned they dont work crazy hours.

It's true, i have seen it for myself. They even tell me that they had previous coworkers who were studying while working full-time because of the free time they had.

Anyway what im trying to get at is this. **Is it worth taking a 17,000 dollar salary cut to regain my sanity and mental health?**

I can move up the ladder and become a senior planner. BTW the salary for this role is higher at other companies, it's just a little lower at my current company. So essentially I can stay here and get promoted to senior role and transfer somewhere else to get a 110,000+ salary.

It feels beneficial to my future in the long run. Although, when I told my family and friends, they told me it was not a good idea.

I am 26! I am so young, I think now is the right time to do it.

Also, i am okay financially to take the pay cut.

Can anyone give me any reasons why i shouldn't do this? I want to make sure I thought it all very through before I proceed.",2024-08-14 04:55:13,1,1,1,Positive,0.038629742806213396,0,0,2

1ansxy3,stress,Tired of Narc GM (70F)trying to control my life. Can I block her?,"To tell the truth I really dislike my GM and I only go around her if I have to. I’m a (18 M) who has had difficulties within his life. 

My dad died when I was 3 and my mom remarried twice to two men. One who she divorced and had my half-brother. He is a cop and former army sergeant currently in fact one of the best in the county. He wasn’t a good man he didn’t care about us truly and once he found out my bro had autism he dipped so quick and was emotionally wasn’t there for 8 years until there divorce. 

 The other who she is currently with who is a asshole convict who ruined my teen years by embarrassing and controlling me with his mental abuse which is a story for another time. 


I haven’t been around my dads(My Family) family in 15 years. I’m just now starting to come around them and be with them. It’s been great so far as I’m currently living with them. And my Aunt (Dads sister) has treated me well and I call her mom. 

My GM is trying to convince me to move out of the house. She thinks that I can live on my own and that I need to get a apartment and do her stupid Photo Booth business for money.  I’ve explained to her multiple times I don’t want to move out as I don’t feel comfortable yet living on my own and on top of that I have autism and ADHD and it is required for me to be supervised by adults. That’s what my doctor said to me in my diagnosis. My Grandfather on my dads side and my aunt-mom both say I need supervision and I’m not mature enough to live on my own as well. And I don’t feel comfortable moving. But she keeps stressing it and it’s getting annoying.

 I’m own the verge of just going off on her I don’t want to be rude but I don’t respect or like how she keeps trying to force and issue that I’ve told her multiple times I’m not interested in doing.

She keeps trying convince to go to this HBCU college within the area I reside in that I’m moving from. Where I’m moving two is about a hour away from me and I’ve told her I going to be  in a community college but she keeps pressing me going to the HBCU which I just told her today I’m not gonna do. Within her family she’s known for failing within her life she also in the past has manipulated and used others for money and she’s can’t keep money as she constantly spends it on driving and trips and other things she doesn’t need. 


She constantly asks people for money when she gets tight on the month. And if you don’t give it to her she guilt trips you. I can’t do it anymore. I’m at a point where I just want to block her.  She doesn’t respect others opinions and thoughts. And I know there are gonna be people saying “but that’s your GM” but I can’t do this anymore. All the stress and games. It’s killing me!!!!!!

My mom had cut all ties with her. Despite her being her mom she tries to control her life as well and I don’t wanna do this shit with her anymore. I’m playing to cut her off.

I don’t want to go to HR because I don’t want to worsen my situation that is changing hopefully in the next few months, and I love this company so I don’t want to quit.

But in the meantime…. My boss stresses me out so much that I can feel it in my body. Constantly. I can feel cortisol rushing through my veins multiple times a week, I’m always tense, I breakdown and sob at least every two weeks. I have been trying so hard to tell myself that my value doesn’t come from this job and to not attach emotions to her emails/ calls, but sometimes it’s just so damn hard and I freak out.

• tingling / buzzing sensation on my face/back/arms/hands/feet.

• waking up throughout the night

• lack of interest and feeling miserable constantly

• seeing shadow-people at the corner of my eyes.

• googling symptoms.

• weird feelings in my head and body.

• worrying about my health.

• asking for reassurance

• symptoms changing or going away and not coming back.

I had two older cousins that dropped out their first year and my mom talked about how sad it was. and always told me to work harder to get my degree

1eqjpxx,college,Nervous about state school ,Hi I’m going into my senior year of high school and I’m narrowing down my college decision. I was given a scholarship for a smaller state for sports and I’m just worried about the school having no social life. The university surrounds a town that only has 5 thousand people while the university has 10 thousand I’m just worried that the university wont be as fun as a larger school. The school is also a top 50 party school in the U.S I don’t know if that changes anything. ,2024-08-12 17:25:42,0,3,1,Positive,0.09847222222222221,0,0,2
1erhljv,stress,Can stress cause blackouts?,"As you might have guessed, I’m super stressed. Work is overwhelming and I can’t get out of my contract for another year. 

I’ve always had a high-stress job and normally I cope really well, but lately when I feel stressed I’ve started doing something weird that I call “blacking out,” though I’m not sure what to call it. I get really bad tunnel vision, sometimes only able to focus on a single item at a time directly in front of me. Sometimes I feel like I can’t see anything at all even though my eyes are open and I’m walking and performing normal tasks. Other times I’ll suddenly see spots of light and I get super nauseous and need to sit down and focus on breathing for a while to make my vision return to normal. 

Does anyone have experience with something like this? Ideas for what it could be and how to help?",2024-08-13 19:59:45,2,3,1,Positive,0.03573412698412699,0,0,2

1es8n2f,college,Going back to undergrad after getting a masters,"Hi y'all, I tried searching this question first and didn't really see anything of merit related to me so I figured I'd ask directly lol...

TLDR; what are your thoughts on going to get another bachelors (or two) after getting your masters to help progress your knowledge in an adjacent field? 

Anyway, I'm graduating with my BFA in studio art this december (at last!!!) and I plan on going for an MFA in the next couple of years. After I've gotten on my feet work/career wise, I really want to go back and get a BS in either Marine Biology/Science or just Environmental Science. My dream job would be to go work for climate based organizations making art for campaigns or textbooks or something and I really want to also have the science background to go along with it. Marine biology was my first academic love before I settled on art lol.

Anyway, I would probably do it online through a school like Unity Environmental since I could do it fully online and I don't necessarily need a top tier school since it's more for my own learning... Plus my mindset would be C's get degrees. I haven't been able to do that since I'm an honors college student, but if I go back it would be just to learn, not to stress about keeping a 3.5+ GPA. 

I also would love to get a theatre degree... I'm minoring in it but I also plan on working in theatre. (My career plans are very eclectic, I know. But it all makes sense in my dream life scenario I promise!)

 I 27M , am waiting for death. I’m still healthy and young but I’m so much debt, my relationship crumbling, working my ass off at work, at home with my son. I cook, clean and take care of my son when I can so my significant other can have a break, my mom who I care for dearly says I’ve been relying on her to much to watch my son when I can’t and is stressing her out. My significant who I adore says I don’t do enough at home, we need to catch up on bills, why am I working late, you can’t do anything around the house. My mother says all I do is take take and take and can’t ever help and that I’ve become selfish. 
 Everyone is frustrated with me, my relationship with my sister is deteriorating, I don’t see my friends all I have is my son who I confide in who’s only 2. 
 I’m so tired and I pray to God that either my big break comes and I’m finally in the green or take my life away. I don’t know how much more longer I can hold it. I truly believe I’ll be seeing death soon if things don’t look up and if anyone figures out who I am with family and friends I’m sorry

196x76a,stress,Stress is the silent killer.,"Mental and emotional stress affects every cell in the body.

  
[Here's a study proving this](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579396/)

  
Stress can adversely affect the genetic makeup in your body; the mind can positively or negatively affect DNA.  


  
Luckily we have one of the fastest, and easiest to feel, method to counteract stress that we can benefit from learning how to activate.  


  
Its present when the natural reaction that our physical body has during euphoric goosebumps. Whether from listening to a song you really like, thinking about a lover, watching a moving movie scene, striving, feeling thankful, praising God, praying, etc.   


  
Really consider this fact. From just being exposed to certain positive thoughts or stimuli, your whole  body or just in certain locations (for now), can experience that blissful wave that's present with chills.  


  
Now consider how beneficial it would be if you learned how to truly induce that feel good occurrence at will. You could definitely use it to counteract overwhelming stress.  


  
If you take time to notice you will find that your self induced positive chills have an accompanying sort of feel-good wave underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot). After researching what that specific current underneath the skin is, I came across a sort of energy that is considered our Life force.

  
This energy has been acknowledged in many cultures and documented under many names like Ruah, Spiritual Energy, Bioelectricity, Life force, Prana, Chi, Qi, Orgone, Rapture, Tension, Aura, Euphoria, Ecstasy, Mana, Vayus, ASMR, Nen, Intent, Tummo, Odic force, Kriyas, Pitī, Frisson, Secret Fire, The Tingles, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Aether, Chills, Spiritual Chills.  


  
If you would like to know how to take control of that feel-good occurrence and how to, at will, stop the paralyzing feeling of stress on it's track.  Here are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) on how to really tap into this.  


  
P.S. Everyone feels this occurrence at certain points in their life, some brush it off while others notice that there is something much deeper going on. Those are exactly the people you can find on r/Spiritualchills where they share experiences, knowledge and tips on it. ",2024-01-15 02:12:20,1,0,1,Positive,0.11229502820411913,0,0,2

1eqla9f,stress,How Stress Affects Your Physical and Mental Health,"Stress is the body’s reaction to perceived or actual detrimental events. The “fight-or-flight” response is set off, which makes one’s heart rate, respiration, muscles tense, and blood pressure rise in an attempt to defend themselves.

However, stress may mean various things to different people, and some can handle stress better than others. Stress can aid in work completion and damage prevention through restraint.

Although our bodies can withstand brief periods of the physical effects of stress, prolonged, chronic stress can have negative effects.

Stress is a complex and specific behavior in a range of circumstances.

Your body, your thoughts and feelings, and your behavior may all be impacted by stress symptoms. Being familiar with common stress symptoms can help you cope with them. There would be a lasting impact of stress on health and can cause several health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes.

1d0a3n7,academia,Struggling with My First Paper as First Author – Seeking Advice on Managing Co-Authors and Deadlines,"Hello everyone,

I am feeling very frustrated and running out of patience. What should I do? Have any of you experienced something similar?

Here’s my situation: I am a recent MSc graduate working on my first paper as first author. Since I want to pursue a PhD, this is very important to me. Even though the paper will likely be published in a ""smaller"" journal, it would be a significant career and confidence boost for me. The paper is based on data I collected during a field course about a year ago, as part of a university course. Therefore, other students who participated in the course are also involved (2 Bachelor students, 4 Master students, and 1 PhD student), along with the professor who offered the course.

I have distributed the tasks as evenly as possible (who writes what, who creates the images/figures, who handles the data, etc.). But the most difficult and challenging part, by far, of this paper is managing the logistics and communication between me and the other co-authors. I feel like I have to ask explicitly for every little thing, even though I keep reminding everyone in every meeting, ""Please keep me updated and CC me."" However, no one keeps me updated, and no one CCs me. When I ask how much longer someone will need to complete their task, I always get the same response, ""I'll be done in 1-2 days."" Then, when I check back in 2 days, I get the same response, and so on. When I set deadlines, they are unfortunately never met.

I feel like, If I were writing the paper alone, I would be finished by now. I often wait weeks for feedback/response or the completion of a task that should take no more than half an hour.   
For example:  I asked someone to send me a reference (since the DOI number had a typo and I couldn’t find the corresponding paper during a quick internet search). The person said they would do it once they got home that day, as they already had the paper as a PDF on their PC. That evening, I asked again, and the person said they had forgotten but would send it first thing in the morning. Again, I didn't hear anything from them. After a week of no response, I followed up and got a similar answer. Then there was silence for several days until I ended up finding the paper myself. Despite having the paper saved on their PC, it took this person over two weeks to send me a PDF via email or WhatsApp.

Since the paper is not very extensive and doesn't involve any statistics, and with 8-9 people contributing, I tried to distribute even the smallest tasks but not too many, as I also want to contribute meaningfully. I am desperate. Is this normal? Am I in a position to remove someone from the project, or would it be professional to have a frank conversation? Could it be due to a lack of experience? Should I be more lenient?

I appreciate any insights or tips.

Thank you!",2024-05-25 11:38:05,0,7,1,Positive,0.09535416666666668,1,0,2

So I've read the ""upside of stress"" and this research article - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3374921/?utm\_source=arnoldspumpclub.schwarzenegger.com&utm\_medium=newsletter&utm\_campaign=can-you-pass-this-test](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3374921/?utm_source=arnoldspumpclub.schwarzenegger.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=can-you-pass-this-test)

And it all points out to the fact that our perception of stress is the thing contributing to its adverse effects.  
But why do we have those perceptions in the first place?

I don't think stress did absolutely nothing to humanity until we heard that ""it's bad for us"".  
Can it be that we're misattributing cause and effect?  
That is, some **types** of stress are perceived as good - caring for a loved one, doing something really hard that we care about (like being a doctor working overtime). Whereas other types - working 12 hours a day at a dead-end job, is stress we perceive as bad, and so it ""hurts"" us more.

Everybody in academia (msc, phd, post docs mostly) is a proud slave. Working lots of hours for very few money in return. Passion is not the equivalent of a decent salary. The whole system is broken. You submit a journal and the comments may return in a period of holidays. Since all that is international somebody's holidays could not be your holidays. The deadlines are strict (10 days or so unless major revisions are required and even so, the prof will be hasty and you know that)

Then you pay to publish (because from when I started to publish 7-8 years ago there where much more free journals but now most of them have a fee). And despite paying you have to fix every little detail to be in accordance with the format. This could be hours of silly work. Then you get the reviewers. One could suggest minor revisions and other could reject it outright. In a paper of mine one was asking me to include a table and when I did the other reviewer wanted to remove the table and was blaming me for having the results twice (as a figure and a table).

Then you publish, so what? You make a tiny little contribution to research. Your paper will stop being cited because when a review or other paper is made you want the most recent literature so a 2015 paper in 2024 will get you a comment ""it seems that 50% of your reference are more than 5 years old"".

As a post doc you can be with an 1 year contract (same goes for phds) with the potential of it getting renewed. So you're always insecure about the outcomes. And although we know that sometimes a drug that doesn't do anything against cancer (for instance) is a useful knowledge so others won't test the same drug for the same thing, you just can't publish that and your research is considered fail and your position can be jeopardized.

If you spend the same amount of time in a pharmaceutical company or in a diagnostic laboratory you will earn way more, you will be treated as a proper employee with your regular leaves etc and with less work. 

I was working until this month in academia while knowing all these but i just wanted some experience in research. But whoever has asked my mind, I advise against a phd most of the times.

  
Oh and another thing. Some professors think that own you and they are not a minority.",2024-08-12 08:31:02,87,32,1,Positive,0.061907894736842106,1,0,2

When I get wound up from stress, it’s difficult for me to complete any other tasks for the day. I have things I know need to be done, but something perhaps unrelated will occur that is stressful and I am in paralysis. 

For example, I’m owed roughly 2k from clients. I’m a freelancer. I have been on their ass for roughly 3 weeks on paying me. They told me four days ago I’d be paid in two days. Well, I’m still not paid. 

This scenario has got me wound up so tight in stress that I cannot make myself do my tasks for the day. I tried going to the pool, doing other activities, doom scrolling, and I’m just sick. 

I need any advice on how to get myself out of this tight ball. If I got paid, that would do the trick but I’ve got $60 to my name and it’s really making me physically ill knowing I’m owed enough money to bring me relief but my client has not paid. 

I’ll try anything. I’m flying tomorrow and I’ve got to do some stuff tonight to prepare. Traveling while in this position is making it worse. I’ve considered cancelling but I’ve paid for everything up to this point. No refunds if I do cancel. 

I’m crawling out of my skin with anxiety and stress. My goal right now is to get through my final tasks for the day. Please send any ideas.

Earlier this year (March) I had my daughter. I got really sick and had to get my gallbladder removed in June. Just before this we were evicted from not paying rent. I’m assuming you can understand why I wasn’t paying it. We moved in with a friend for a month and a half, my step grandpa for about 3 months and now we live with my boyfriend’s parents. I’m still sick with constant diarrhea from my cholecystectomy. Tons of anxiety & stress of course. I started buspirone which is an anxiety medication to treat general anxiety. I don’t know if it helps or not but I take it anyway. 

I don’t know where to begin to get rid of this. We are working on getting our own place the beginning of this year but a new baby and living with people makes things so much more difficult. Is anyone on a medication to treat stress? There’s no way for me to treat this at the moment clearly, I have to minimize stress in order to accomplish something. 

I’ve taken a few vitamins, including GABA and goodbye stress. Didn’t do much of course, I’m also incredibly overweight (in my opinion) I’m 21 5’5 and almost 220. So I don’t know if that contributes.

1d22zum,university,"Seeking Guidance: Left My Initial University Alone for Better Opportunities, Now Preparing for Entrance Exams, Uncertain of Decision","Hi everyone, I recently made the tough decision to leave the university I initially joined in pursuit of a better academic environment that aligns more closely with my future goals. While I was excited to begin my journey at my first university, I soon realized that the teaching methods and faculty approach weren't conducive to my learning style and aspirations.

Despite my efforts, I found myself disheartened by the preferential treatment given to students who completed their undergraduate studies at the institution. It seemed as though opportunities were more readily available to them, leaving me feeling overlooked and undervalued. Additionally, I felt the teachers were more supportive of undergraduates, leaving little room for assistance to students like myself who transferred in.

One of the main issues I faced was the lack of time for rigorous study. The constant stream of exams, sometimes even weekly, left me feeling overwhelmed and unable to delve deeply into important concepts. It felt like a race to regurgitate information rather than truly understanding and learning.

What adds to my uncertainty is the fact that I was the only one among my peers to leave the university. While they seemed content with the status quo, I couldn't shake the feeling that I needed more.

Now that I'm on a path to prepare for entrance exams for other universities, I'm feeling uncertain about whether I've made the right choice. Leaving my first university was a tough decision, but I knew it was necessary for my academic and personal growth. However, as I delve into studying for entrance exams, doubts have started to creep in.

To make matters more challenging, I've encountered a setback as I'm unable to dedicate time for rigorous study for the next month. This has only added to my anxiety and uncertainty about my decision.

I can't help but wonder if I'm making the right choice or if I'm just running away from challenges. I felt like I was skipping valuable concepts just to keep up with the pace, while others seemed to effortlessly gobble up what the teachers taught and regurgitate it on the exam paper.

I'm reaching out to the community for guidance and support during this uncertain time. Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? How did you navigate the process of leaving one university and preparing for entrance exams for another, especially when faced with time constraints and a less-than-ideal learning environment?

Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

I don’t want to, there are just no other decent paying jobs around me so it’s my only option really. To be honest though, everything I mentioned above is not what I disliked about a trade.

I messed up my first 20% test by not only not doing a good job but also submitting late and the lecturer has not replied if he will accept my assignment. Also we were suppose to submit the hardcopy of our test as well and I did that but I was so nervous and anxious I did not talk to him about how I submitted late the soft copy and if will submit it or not.

To top it all off, the prof is taking a 6% test on our next week’s class that will be exchanged with the 6% of the initial test as no one did well on that. However, I will be unable to attend that class as I am not in the city next week. The 20% group assignment is done but I’m also not sure how it really went. 

Now I know some of you will suggest to talk to the prof but 1) he’s a very rigid prof and 2) I have severe anxiety of talking to my profs about this and messing up. I don’t even know what I will say to him that doesn’t make the situation worse.

Tw for topics if grief and death, especially pet death this will also be very long

For context, I live in a very very country part of the south US. Like, cow field withing every two miles. I luve with only my grandmother and we have a pretty big yard, a little over two acres I think. We have a house medium sized house with a garage separate from the house, a driveway between. About 1,000 feet, maybe less, I'm not good with distance, is this big workshop. All of it was built by my grandfather and when he passed the old workshop, which we just call the shop, wasn't taken care of. Eventually, my uncle decided to start doing work down there. Problem is, he has a very severe hoarding problem. I've been in the building recently and there's only a very thing path to squeeze through and even then there's things on the floor. Things are stacked all the way to the ceiling. There's two gains trailers, like 18 wheeler trailers outside, god knows what's in them. There's things just laying around everywhere and there are thousands of cans. And I genuinely mean THOUSANDS of aluminum cans. He says he wants to melt them, but he never has.

Obviously, all this is really bad. What makes it worse, is it attracts rats and mice. When you have tons of rats and mice  in a building, you attract predators. When you live in the woods, there's plenty of predators. We'd never had a problem before, but now in the past few months we've had several hawks, a bobcat, some and the newest, a fox. There's a fox living in a hole at the shop, and that's our new problem.

See, we have 5 cats. Or, we did have 5 cars a few days ago. We didn't know about the fox yet. I'm not able to keep my cats inside because of my grandmother, as well as the fact that they just hate it inside. These are our cats

Raven: roughly 5 years, technically the favorite
Delilah: roughly 3 years
Honey: roughly 1 year, Oliver's sister
Oliver: roughly 1 year, Honey's brother
Thunder: 4 months

Last Monday I went out at about 6 am to feed them since I'd had trouble sleeping that night. Raven sleeps in my room but hates staying inside during the day. The others sleep outside as they never go far from the house and sleep on there back porch. I couldn't find Honey and Thunder anywhere. I kept calling until I saw something brown laying in the yard near the shop. I knew immediately and ran down there to find Honey. There was no blood, but o lying a small strip of meat from her side. She hadn't been eaten, there were few marks. She was already stiff and the Flys had gotten to her. I started crying and screaming. I had a panic attack and ran back inside to tell my grandmother and call my mom. I kept screaming for Raven and Thunder. After about an hour when I'd calmed a bit, we were trying to find a box big enough for her when I saw Thunder in our front yard. He was alive, but heavily injured. He was dragging himself to the house with his front legs. We immediately took him to the vet and they treated him. He got some shots and got everything cleaned up. His legs are okay. He had one puncture wound and a few abrasions on him. He's stabbed over now and is able to walk. The vet said that whatever it was, he was trying to get away.

We kept the cats inside all night and kept strict watch. I saw the thing a few times now. Me and a different uncle went down to put poison in the hole and filled it with big rocks and dirt. The holes still covered now. At that time, I'd thought it was a weasel. We had a wildlife removal guy come to look at everything. I looked with him and he said it was most likely a fox, possibly a mongoose that someone put out. Luckily the thing isn't rabid, because it's terrified of me. As it should be because the second I get my hand on it it'll feel more pain and fear than my babies ever did.

It's now Friday morning at 1:47 and I'm damn near having a panic attack for the fourth time today. I hate my uncle for it. This is his fault. We can't trap the fox, it's expensive and more will just come back. We have to get rid of the rats. But my uncle gad that fucking holding problem and you can't clean that stuff out in a day. I've talked to my grandma and told her if he doesn't fix his shit I'm burning it down and blaming it on the rats because I'm so terrified of my cats getting hurt.

He hasn't been here yet so we haven't spoke to him but we have to. I've talked about all the things we need to do to fix this, but as of right now, we have Varela enough money to keep ourselves going. We can't afford to fix all this. We already have mice in our walls. They haven't gotten fully inside yet but it's only a matter of time.

We've been keeping Delilah, Oliver, and thunder in the garage. Thunder stayed in my room the first couple days cause I wanted to watch over him. When he first got back from the vet, he was wobbling from his exhaustion, but I was worried it was a head injury. I couldn't sleep and kept waking him up because he's a heavy sleeper and I was terrified he was going to die too. Raven sleeps in my room and is currently asleep beside my legs.

Raven yells loud at me when she wants out. She's fast and will slip out at any chance. she likes going into the woods around our house and hanging out with the neighbor cats. She's also clingy and hates being in my room alone. I've been having trouble sleeping the past few days from stress. For some added context, I have been diagnosed with ocd, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, other specified depressive disorder, and am currently getting tested for autism. I'm a generally anxious person all the time, bit this has made it significantly worse. I also have a derealization or dissociation disorder. It was a coping mechanism but now it just happens for weeks on end. Honeys death threw me deep into one and being awake at night is making it significantly worse. I want to go to my grandmother's room and sleep beside her since it'll give me a bit more comfort, but raven will start yelling. Ive tried keeping her inside and she absolutely will not have it. I tried tying a very long rope around a pole and putting a clip on it. I put her in a harness and attached the clip to her harness, but she got out very quickly.

I keep remembering her body. I've had plenty cats die over my life, even though I'm only 17. I've had. Plenty cats die from many things, old age, disease, some just go missing. I've seen bodies before. I've seen other cats that weren't mine who unfortunately had far more gruesome and graphic deaths. But this was MY cat. This is the first time I've seen one of my own babies like that.

We started with letting raven out. Strictly in the day when it's bright out. I'd go out every couple minutes to make sure nothing had happened. Then we started letting the others out. They stay near the house so they're less stressful.

I've gone down there, checked around, yelled out at it even when I didn't see it. I shoot at it with a bb gun since that's all I've got right now. I've been harrasing this damn fox every chance I get. I haven't seen it in 2 days. Not a single sign. We covered its hole and I saw it that night with a flashlight, and then never again. I've watched constantly, terrified for the moment I go out and see it again

Problem is, I went back out tonight and saw something walking up from the woods. I could see it's eyes form the flashlight. It ran back off into the woods. I don't know what it was. Could have been a rabbit, fox, weasel, squirrel, cat, anything. But there's that fear.

I feel so completely trapped. I can't sleep in my own room but I can't go to another when ravens inside. I can't sleep during the day because I can't fully trust when my grandmother watches them because unless I physically see them myself, I'm not calm. Unless I see all of them in the same place, I'm not calm, and that rarely happens since raven doesn't really like the others. Even if I do sleep in the day, I keep waking up from nightmares. I've barely slept in days, my head hurts constantly, I keep breaking down and having panic attacks and anxiety attacks. We don't have money to fix the problem fast enough. I can't leave them alone outside because I don't trust it and I have to keep them inside at night. I can't leave my house because then I can't watch them and if I bring then inside then they'll complain all night. My best friends brithday is in 2 days and I want to hang out but I'm so terrified the second I leave something will happen.

I can't loose another cat. I can't handle seeing another one of my babies dead. In feel like thers no escape and there's so much stress and it feels like the only way to stop it is death. I don't want to die by any means but I think the stress itself might just kill me on its own. I start school soon and I have no idea what to do. I'm so fucking exhausted and scared and I don't know what to do",2024-07-19 07:35:35,3,5,1,Negative,-0.004492108333167953,0,0,0

1elweim,careeradvice, Feeling Uncertain About Law School - Need Career Advice,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently a senior majoring in political science and was all set to apply to law school before I graduate this upcoming fall/winter. I've been interning at a law firm under a business lawyer for a while now, and it's making me question if law is the right path for me. I've started to feel like I might actually hate the work or at least not be happy doing it long-term.

  
I've always said I wanted to be a lawyer, and my parents are willing to help me pay for law school, which makes things feel even more complicated. I feel guilty about having doubts now that everything seems lined up for me to pursue this path. I don't want to waste their support, and it's tough to shake the feeling that I might be letting them down. This makes the decision even more overwhelming, especially since I've been committed to this plan for so long.

During work, I often find myself browsing jobs where people seem happy or careers that offer a good work-life balance. I'm starting to wonder if I'm just not cut out for this type of work. I'm scared of being inside and at a desk for so long, as well as merely working on monotonous cases with disgruntled people.  

One big reason I'm reconsidering law school is my girlfriend. She’s really passionate about the film industry and wants to move from Seattle to LA to pursue her career there. I've been dating her for 3 years and would really like to pursue a life with her. My original plan was to get a law degree and eventually join her in LA, but the thought of staying up here for another three years just feels dreadful.

I'm open to the idea of grad school, but law is starting to sound less appealing. Part of me just wants to graduate, take my chances, and move to LA with my girlfriend to job search, but I’m worried about making such a big/silly decision. I would have no support system. 

I should mention that this internship is my first major full-time job. Last summer, I worked about 32 hours a week as a barista/shift supervisor. While I didn't always love it, I didn't hate it either. At first, I thought maybe I just don't like working in general, but I know I want to work hard and enjoy what I do.

Am I in over my head, or is this just a typical career crisis moment? I’d love to hear any advice or experiences you might have.

Thanks in advance!",2024-08-06 23:18:19,1,0,1,Positive,0.04903687169312169,0,0,2

18dfw5w,stress,Stressreaction towards nothing (relationship related),"My partner (m27) and I (f32) went through a rough patch this summer. There were not a lot of happy moments and just fighting or silence for a few months. He is bad at working through his own emotions so when he is feeling down, he will lash out. Paired with my problem that I want to solve situations and cannot give him space, it was just a bad mix. So I was super stressed around him and got very careful what to say and where to step. A lot of crying and anger inside of me about the situation.

Skip a few months, he has been doing way better and it went upwards and we have been back to the way we used to live together and be there for each other (and not as it felt before; constantly against each other). 
However, I cannot get rid of the stress reactions of my body. When he is upset about anything, I’m immediately in flight or fight mode. When his voice gets louder (not even against me, just for example when something is not working out) or he just seems down but doesn’t want to talk, I can feel my body tending up, my heartbeat hasten and sometimes my eyes just start tearing up. I can feel the unrest and uneasiness immediately and it will stay for a while even after the situation (in which I’m not even involved) is over.

It is a reaction that partly made sense when things were bad, but now I experience the same stress reactions about nothing/very little.

I am kinda feeling stressed about other aspects of being alive as well.
I don't think I am trans, but since childhood i have had transvestite fetish and this has made me feel euphoria when I think of myself as woman, i sometimes feel dysphoria, but I can't really accept it, I don't hate being a man.
I sometimes wanna have female anatomy and still have my masucline personality, but i can't really see myself as feminine cause my biological sex and hormones has given me overall masculine growth, which i don't hate at all, but i sometimes wish it was not this way. 
I sometimes wanna be attracted to men, and have gay thoughts, and it makes me aroused cause i feel feminine because of it.
Then i just feel bad and ashamed, I am straight in terms of my birth sex, and I don't hate it, but sometimes it makes me feel invalid and bad and wants me to erase or switch my attraction to man only. 
I want one of these parts to shut off, cause this is making me feel distressed and weird now.

1eljzzb,careeradvice,Should I quit my job?,"So basically Ive been working as gate agent for the last 2 years. My salary it’s slightly above minimum wage and I feel like there is no progression in my career, in fact I’m actually taking an almost 10% salary payout from this month and beyond. For the last two days I’ve been working on the 4am shifts ( it’s like a week every 4/6 weeks) and god damn it feels like I’ll never get used to this. I’ve slept an total of 5hours in the last 48hours and I know this must have some impact on my health. And I’m not even talking about dealing with angry and misbehaved passengers almost every single day…
Currently and for the last 4 months I have a business with my father (tobacco/convenience shop) and I know that could support me financially for a while. And although I have some fun running this business I don’t want to be working on a convenience shop selling vapes and lottery tickets all my life too. I feel like I could do something more challenging. I’m thinking about going back to college someday.

Up to this point it seems easy to tell me I should just quit my gate agent job and stick with my business for a while but im going to share what’s been holding me back:

First of all, I don’t hate my job, I hate the conditions of it.. I’ve had way worst jobs in the past tbh. 
I enjoy being around with my colleagues after all, there are really nice people in that job.
I enjoy working at a fast pace environment, and under pressure like the airport.
If I just stay running my own business my only colleague will be my father, which don’t get me wrong, and I love him but that would have it’s impacts on my social life.

What should I do? I feel like I should move on and quit but I’m afraid I’ll have to find another thing eventually and I don’t know if I’ll be able to find something better.

1b2s5vo,stress,How to speak to my manager,"Hi all, 

This is a long story so apologies in advance..in need of advice.

I work in a call centre the last almost four years and my partner tells me I'm on the verge of burnout. I'm super stressed, to the point where I'm actually passing out stupidly early or can't sleep at all and only seem to be able to relax in the evenings with a drink of something..not a lot or anything, literally one drink, never was a big alcohol drinker. 

Basically the last year has been hell, one of my parents has advanced COPD and is on 24hr oxygen and in and out of hospital, last hospital trip resulted in steroid induced psychosis, my other parent is their carer both in their 70s and hospitals being shit in Ireland they sent my parent home with this so after work everyday I was helping look after them to give my other parent a break.. I'm not going into detail on all of that, you get the idea.. anyway personal life a lot going on.  Early December I found out I was pregnant and was super happy about this. Then in January I had a miscarriage.. scariest most traumatic thing I've experienced.. literally thought I was dying.. 

Anyway super stressed in my personal life and work right now. My team leader recently asked if i would take on extra calls, I agreed without thinking about it because I'm a people pleaser.. and had my 1st round of training for these last week, I quickly realised these calls were awful.. basically I have to call every person who gives a bad rating on a survey to our department and who wants a callback.. basically every asshole who calls through in our department to try bring up our customer service rating.. when I realised what these calls were I sent an email to my Team lead saying I didn't think I was in the right place to be dealing with that many irate customers right now given recent events ie miscarriage.. and that my day to day calls were stressful enough.. I'm going through fertility testing and have been told stress can stop the body ovulating so to limit my stress etc.. yep trying to get pregnant again  limited time, I'm old, 39.

Anyways my email was basically ignored. I was thrown into more training today for these calls and basically had a mini breakdown and started crying... I've never cried on this job.. I'm so stressed and I don't know how to make my team leader listen to me on this.

Any suggestions greatly appreciated.. I'm afraid to have the conversation face to face because I'm angry my concerns have been brushed off and that if I have this conversation face to face I could lose my temper or cry like a crazy person again.. I hate crying in front of strangers...

1dovhqn,stress,Modern life stress,"Not sure if this is the group for this, but its stress related, so maybe people can help.

Modern life is too stressful, and i feel more stressed since I removed a lot of modern distractions that aren't good for mental health either. Modern things aren't natural and I feel its doing more harm than good to all of us, mentally and physically.

Since the beginning of 2024 I have cut out porn, social media, a lot less tv, and try not to use my phone, mostly now only used to learn German on duolingo.
Since this change, I've grown a stronger desire to be more connected with nature and remove myself from modern society. This is making me hate everything that comes with modern life and everything is now stressing me out.

I know I'm just whining right now, and tbf I just needed to vent, but thought I'd share this in the hopes others feel the same and know any good coping mechanisms to deal with the monotony of modern life (particularly with having to work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week).

1ehuehu,careeradvice,Pushing for a manager role,"I'm looking for some options on this. Maybe some outside eyes. 

TLDR: old not great manager is on Mat leave and now may be the opportunity to come in and get things running smoothly.

I came from a larger company in a specific field and went to a smaller one. To give some background it's medical  sales and equipment. I started out as a technician, worked my way up specializing in many areas, then became a sales specialist (top)

At the new small company I'm not exaggerating when I say I am the most experienced and most versatile as I have worked all the levels. I also took a territory and increased sales 300%. I am in my third year here, 14 in the industry.

I worked with the owner and mentioned becoming (on top of my sales) the technical department head to help get that department up to the next level. They are hiring me an assistant to offload some duties so I can do this. 

Now the dilemma....my manager was always a backseat manager. Left us to our own devices and did more of the supportive admin work. They have since gone on maternity leave. To cover for her the idea was for a couple new admin hires to do most of her duties and some was outsourced. But with HR moving people, new people starting and confused, one person quiting, there is just chaos and confusion. The rest of the sales team is worried not having the manager as support and the new hires not knowing their duties. 

I think this may be the right time to just go to the owner and HR and just advocate and say ""look, it's not really great down there and everyone is worried. Give me the reigns and I will get things in order"". ( In professional terms of course)

Now this isn't a great time for me either as I have several people to train and keep up with my sales. But this may be the opportunity to make the company I want to work for as well as become a leader and manager. 

Thoughts?

1anl43s,stress,Trauma response to minor inconveniences,"The past couple of years have been horrendous for me. My father passed away in July after a very horrible battle with alcoholism, and I left my partner of 6 years in May because they were just incredibly unsupportive and very draining. The year before that, my Grandmother passed after having essentially given up and refused to eat/drink. 

I moved back in with my Mum last May, and we're practically living in a Barbie Dream House together. We are so happy vibing together, and finally, everything is good for us. We can talk about everything that we've been through and are incredibly supportive of each other. 

The problem I'm currently experiencing is a physiological response to minor inconveniences, and I'll do my best to explain what I mean.

After everything we've endured, things are finally calm and safe, but it took me a while to get here. For the first couple of months after I moved back in with Mum, I realised that I had all these triggers my ex had instilled in me, but I overcame them and that's great! It took a very steady decline from heightened levels of anxiety to get to where I am now.

However, I'm finding that very small inconveniences are triggering quite a severe physical stress response, for example, my dog getting slightly sick or my car breaking down. I can rationalise these in my head and recognise that they're not a major issue, and are nothing I need to really worry about, but it's as if my body gets a rush of cortisol and I go into mild shock (shaking, faint, racing heart etc.), and then I can't eat or sleep and feel incredibly nauseous. 

It's almost as if my body is so conditioned to being in a constant state of stress, it doesn't matter that my brain can recognise and rationalise - my body just reacts the way it's used to.

Is that making any sense? And if so, how do I go about fixing this? Am I better speaking to a GP about the physiological aspects of what's happening, a psychiatrist about (what I suspect is) a mental disconnection, or even both? 

I'd be very grateful to hear if anyone else has experienced this and how they went about resolving it!",2024-02-10 17:13:19,1,4,1,Positive,0.15490549289891398,0,0,2

1bu7obb,stress,"Struggling with Anxiety and Perfectionism in New Job, Need Advice","Hey everyone,
  
I'm reaching out because I'm feeling incredibly overwhelmed and anxious about my new job, and I could really use some advice.
  
I've always been a perfectionist, and I've been proud of my dedication and dependability in all of my previous roles. In fact, I've frequently found myself covering for lazy coworkers and managers who couldn't be bothered doing their jobs correctly on time. While they appreciated my dedication, it frequently left me exhausted and stressed, but it was also nice to feel appreciated for being useful and worthwhile.
  
I recently got a new job that seemed like a dream come true. It offered higher pay and more personal control over shift times, work attire, and personal device use, which I thought would be an excellent fit for me, as I'd always felt limited in that area in previous jobs. However, since starting the job a week ago, I've discovered that it's far more stressful and demanding than I expected.
  
I'm struggling to keep up with the workload while trying to learn all of the necessary information, which also changes weekly. My new coworkers have been helpful in answering my questions, but they've also been brutally honest about constantly being confronted with new challenges such as difficult daily targets, toxic managers, and a lack of HR support. I find myself arriving early, staying late, and even foregoing my lunch breaks in an attempt to catch up, but it never seems to be enough for me.
   
To make matters worse, the stress and anxiety have started to take a toll on my physical health. I've been having trouble sleeping and eating due to IBS flare-ups, and I feel like I'm constantly on edge.
  
I've talked to friends and family about how I'm feeling, and they've suggested that I need to stop putting so much pressure on myself to be the perfect workhorse and start slacking like the rest of the people I've worked with. But the thought of not doing my job properly really terrifies me, and I can't shake the feeling that if I don't catch up, I'll be reprimanded by my manager or fired instantly.
  
I know I need to strike a balance and prioritise my mental health, but I'm not sure where to begin. How can I stop being anxious and become more relaxed and carefree like some of my former coworkers? I despise feeling like I'm failing at my job, but I also dislike feeling like I'm falling apart when I come home. And quitting is not an option because it took me so long to find a decent paying job in my area.
  
Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",2024-04-02 19:28:26,6,3,1,Positive,0.11811394819869397,0,0,2

I am currently in the industry. I am fine: I receive a decent salary, and work 80\~90% of my time at home.

The offers I've received to teach are better in terms of salary (I would probably be able to, at least, increase my current salary by 50%). However, I may have to let go of my ""work from home comfort"".

The only reason I'm contemplating this offer is, mostly, the end goal of my work. I work in the industry in consultancy, and I do a lot of work for different brands and organizations.

1dziohe,academia,Need advice for my future plans - worried about money insecurity for my passion,"Hello all,

I'm currently struggling with confidence in my future plans and would appreciate some advice :)

To preface this, I am a senior in HS and have a pretty extreme passion for Astronomy - I do astrophotography, read lots of literature, watch lots of videos, take courses on it etc...

I would love to go into Astrophysics in the future as it is truly my passion and I have no real want to do anything else, however I am really worried about the job security and money side of things. I am specifically worried about getting a PHD and beyond as I know PHD students are really constrained on money and I would really like not to have to deal with that - I know a side job is an option but I have also heard that most of the time a PHD student has is spent on research... therefore not a lot of room for extra work opportunities. I feel like I would be more willing to do this if the outlook on the other side looked quite promising, however, from what I've seen, astrophysics is an incredibly competitive field with many ending up in other sectors, often industry or finance in order to earn a decent living. This makes me think why I should even go down the road of astrophysics in the first place if I would most likely have to switch careers down the road to something less desirable (ex. finance)  
  
What would you suggest I do? I know I have lots of time but I am a person who plans out everything long term and as undergrad is coming up soon, I would really like to have that sense of security.

1dsmxv9,stress,Dealing with Noisy Family and Need Advice,"
Hi everyone,

I'm Vivek, and I've been struggling with a noisy and conflict-ridden family environment at home. My parents frequently argue, and it's challenging to find a quiet space to focus on my goals. We live in a small 1BHK house, and I feel overwhelmed trying to balance personal aspirations with the constant noise.

Here's a bit about my situation:
- Our living space is limited, making it difficult to find a quiet place to work or study.

- I find it hard to communicate my need for a quieter environment to my family.

- The only quiet time I have is between 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., which isn't always feasible due to sleep schedules.

I want to focus on personal growth, fitness, and pursuing my career goals, but the family dynamics often hinder my progress. I also hesitate to share these issues outside the family due to privacy concerns and potential repercussions.

If anyone has been through a similar situation or has advice on managing family noise while trying to achieve personal goals, I would greatly appreciate your insights and suggestions.",2024-07-01 07:19:29,1,2,1,Positive,0.008250876108018964,0,0,2
1eskdrh,college,How to maintain dorm room hygiene ,"Hi! I'm an incoming Freshman and this is something that's been concerning me.   
I've never been good at maintaining a clean space, and my parent's expectations for how clean my room should be have never been particularly high (the house has always been very cluttered in general). Coming into college, I want to keep my space much neater, but I'm not sure how haha. Especially when I get stressed with school, my garbage gets full, laundry isn't done, and my desk is full of plates and wrappers.   
Do you guys have any tips for consistently maintaining a semi-clean dorm even with a limited schedule (will be working part time as well)

Recently I’ve been taking on a lot more responsibility at work such as taking lead on some critical projects. This past week as we are at the early stages of these projects. It’s definitely been a high stress high energy week. During the week I can say anything felt incredibly rough just a lot of fast paced days. I’m taking a 4 day weekend to recharge and when I got home from work last night I suddenly felt horrible. My body started shivering and even today I feel sick. I’m guessing this is a case of burnout and I can now see I need to make some significant adjustments to my workload. But for the moment does anyone have any tips for recovering from this? I’m 420 friendly and smoking has definitely helped but I don’t feel like just being high the whole time is the recovery I need. ",2024-06-08 16:51:28,1,2,1,Negative,-0.00798185941043084,0,0,0

I've had stress for years. It comes and goes, worse or better. I have several doctors and have a ton of ""as needed"" medications I try not to use unless I need them. 

Right now I'm in school full time and working full time, on top of family stress, and now my health deteriorating (from the stresss....) it just feels like an endless cycle. 

A few years ago I got tremors for a few weeks with a bad episode.

Now it's hives. 

And migraines. 

What can I do? I'm trying to get good sleep; the meds and supplements I have sometimes don't help (like taking an allergy med for the hives can make me tired so I don't work as well then I'm stressed about work). 

I have a rherapist, she's awesome. She's working with helping me. 

I just feel like day to day it's always sometbjng and lately it's been physical manifestations of the stress. I also have tinnitus and it's so loud it's driving me insane. I've been able to tolerate it before but now is really bad. 

I started growing herbs on my porch and going for walks. I get decent sleep. I don't know what else to do. I always want to cry because no day every feels normal.

184wmyj,stress,I’m drowning,"I feel like my life is collapsing. I’m so stressed I don’t know what to do about it.  
For context, I’m a high school senior, on the outside, everything‘s going great. My grades at great, and I’m on track for a good uni. But I’m absolutely dying. I have finals coming up that I don’t have time to study for. I have college deadlines that need to be met. I have extracurricular clubs that require my time but I don’t have the time to give.

  
I committed to these clubs/ECs last year, when everything was easy and I dident have to worry about much, and I can’t leave them. Like I signed up for a tutoring job last year. Everything was going great. She only assigned me one student and I was happy. But now she wants to (understandably) add more students to my schedule. When she asked for my availability, I gave her the dates when I dident have school. But, I forgot (I don’t know how) that that’s also when my mother is off of work, and when I usually see her. But she’s been so kind and understanding that I can’t change my hours, and am just going to have to deal with it.

  
Then, I got locked out of texts (Storage issue) and I’ve missed lot of important messages and a meeting. I’m even wasting time right now as I type this.

  
I’m so stressed. I don’t know what to do. I’m so tired, I just want a break. I genuinely just want to take a break from it all.",2023-11-27 06:38:33,3,2,1,Positive,0.3156689342403628,1,0,2
1ejphy2,careeradvice,Stressed about being behind compared to uni peers (Career),"Hello all, first question on Reddit but might as well. I’m a 25 year old woman in Switzerland and graduated from the école hôtelière de Lausanne, a prestigious business school with an axis in hospitality and hotel management in addition to the classic curriculum (finance, marketing, etc.). 

During my studies, I went through 3 deaths in my close family and friends circle and went through 2 depressive episodes, with one where I nearly died (survivor). This affected my academic performance which meant I graduated with a 3.1 GPA which is lower than what I wanted (3.3). 

I worked for a business school specialising in executive education as a project manager for a whole MBA program for 2 years and left about 1 month ago because I felt I was not progressing. 

Now I’m jobless and some of my uni peers are already business analysts/consultants/associates or have a masters degree and are at a much higher salary than me. 

I’m pretty lost about what I want to do and feel incredibly behind, or have the constant impression that I didn’t understand the stakes of choosing the right first job, feel like I shot myself in the foot. 

I’m hesitating on attending the Ecole 42 (a coding school that’s well known) in August to acquire coding skills in python, shell, c and hope to become a data analyst. 

Any advice/opinion?

1doc87a,stress,A sick relative is causing me severe stress. ,"I’m hoping I can post this anonymously so no one close to me can find it. But I really don’t know what else to do as everyone I talk to seems to tell me the same old crap that doesn’t comfort me at all. For context. I am autistic and I don’t like change in routine or bad things happening. I also suffered a major trauma from a surgery I had 15 years ago and have gotten ptsd from it. This also seems to happen whenever someone close to me is sick. Varying from mild to severe like this. 

So my mom has an infection. She got it checked out and has been in the hospital ever since. Kept getting told it was nothing then got a text Thursday night 8pm saying she was scheduled for surgery on it. Of course this sent me into overdrive and I was screaming down the phone to her saying to come home. She had the doctor on the phone to me who said it was gonna be sepsis and there may be a need for amputation. Well of course this has led to me having panic attacks and everything. I got sent home from work. 
I went to drop a few things off Friday thinking that I was able to pick her up at dinner time just like I was told on the phone. That was the next lie. I was also refused entry to the room and had my things snatched from me and taken due to a panic attack. I was told she’d come home at 8pm. I was not corrected when I asked if amputation was needed or even necessary. So this led to more worry on the way home. 
8pm arrives and I text momma to see if she wanted collecting and I get told no. Freaking no after I was told to my face to return at 8pm. This was Friday night and I’m sure they knew exactly what they was doing because it escalates. They say she can go home Saturday. 
Saturday I ask once again what time will momma be coming home and I get told once again midday. I was at pride and thought cool they’ll be home when I’m home. Oh no. I get yet another text saying they’re not allowed to do any releases until Monday despite saying that the infection had gone and stuff. So I waited until Monday. Monday rolls around and I ask once again what time. I go into work trying to be normal. I get a text at work telling me that the infection had never gone and wasn’t allowed back for the 5th time. It’s now Tuesday and I have been given the same crap I get every day. A constant cycle of yes in the morning no in the evening. I feel like I’m not being told everything. 

This has caused me so much stress it’s unreal. First the nurses told my mom I was making things up and denied they said anything about sepsis or whatever. They also haven’t made me feel at ease at all. Lying to momma about going home then an hour later saying no. For 5 days me and mom have gotten into arguments and then hours later I’ll be on the phone sobbing and apologising like crazy. Only to be lied to again or the doctor not doing a release. Which starts the cycle again. 

I haven’t eaten since Saturday. I’ve not left the house in 2 days. I’m signed off sick from work for a week. I can’t stop crying. My chest is so tight it hurts. I have heart palpitations. I’m vomiting every time I try and put food in my mouth. I have daily nosebleeds. I have a constant sense of doom and if I don’t get a text atleast once a day I automatically assume that something bad has happened. 

I just want to know? Is this panic all from past trauma? I seem to freak out if anyone close to me has to be in the hospital for a period and it’s to the point where I’m getting sick over it. Constantly begging the person to come back home where it is “safe from things like surgery and ICU” it’s always the worst case that I fear and I even fear death. Everyone says it’s too much tv but I can’t even watch anything about medical stuff as it induces the same stress. I googled about it being a severe fear or a trauma response. But honestly I don’t know. I just want to know why I was lied to but no one will tell me.

This entire year I've felt on top of the world, I've been killing it in my job, social life, and in the gym. I worked hard, played hard, took my health seriously and felt great because of it. This has been a theme for the past two years.

However, recently I went through a stressful period, where I had to move house resulting in a longer commute (1h each way instead of 20 minutes). I also was chosen to be a substitute team lead at work during the two week vacation of our usual team lead, resulting in increased responsibilities on my end (and wanting to prove that I could handle them). I'm also studying a masters degree part time and had to spend my entire Sunday working on it about two weeks ago.

This resulted in me not being able to sleep well that Sunday night, only being able to fall asleep at 5am and I needed to be up at 8 for work. Since then, I feel like I've been in hell. I have had insomnia for around a week, even resulting in me missing half a day of work because I slept through my alarm. Now I got my sleeping back under control for most nights through deep breathing and a melatonin supplement, but I've started having panic attacks where I feel short of breath, break out into a cold sweat, and feel an overwhelming sense of doom, like the color is draining from my face and my brain starts telling me im dying and having a heart attack or a siezure.

I've started to get tremors as well, where I can't hold my hands steady, and even my sense of balance seems thrown off, like I'm constantly swaying. I feel anxious throughout the day, and I feel like I'm in a loop as I'm feeling anxious about being anxious. This was a sudden and somewhat serious change of pace for how I normally feel, I don't feel like myself at all, and I've been crying at night and hugging my pillows like they're going to die.

I've stopped my intake of weed ever since that first sleepless night, and have started taking ashwaganda in an attempt to lower my cortisol levels. I've also lowered my coffee intake to one a day.

Is this all stress related or is there something more villainous at play here that I should go see a doctor about? My sober intuition says that it's just stress and I shoukd ride the symptoms out and keep exercising harder to relieve the stress, but my panic attacks tell me that I'm dying and need help.

I'd usually finish work at around 8pm/9pm, and spend the rest of the evening studying for exams - either to 1am or 2am. This was during lockdown, and even when things were re-opening. I went for ages without seeing people. If I failed the exams, my job would be terminated. It was a bit stressful, but I totally managed. I did well in my exams, tough at times, but I was completely fine. It was three months of being very busy, but after, I had a more normal routine. I left that job two and a half years ago, to do what I thought would be my dream job. It was incredible for the first 6 months, almost too good to be true. I'd reliably finish around 7pm, and did not feel overwhelmed ever. I couldn't believe how relaxed it was. Then things got busy. Since Jun-2023 until Jun-2024, a 10pm finish (starting at 9:40am) would be a very very good day. I'd say for a year, mostly, working hours have easily been 9:40 am to midnight at least, often 2am, and at worst 5am. I had a panic attack in Feb-24, for the first time in my life. I had two weeks of leave in March which helped. Then, this Jul-24, it was suddenly quiet-ish for two weeks. I think everything caught up with me at once. I have not felt like myself for a few months. A constant voice in my head telling me I'm a failure, a ""can't do"" attitude, not wanting to eat, struggling to remember basic things, terrible short-term memory, cynicism, and a dread for the future. Against, this background, work has started to get busy, and my mind is not in a good state. I had a call this morning with my boss and the CFO. I was already in tears before the day started. I couldn't follow a single thing on that call. He asked if I understood what was going on - I had no idea. I just had to say ""no, I'm sorry, I'm not following, and I need to be on sick leave."" The people I work for are incredibly kind - my manager is amazing. I do not know how she does it. I think her hours are worse than mine. Every day I never ever want to let her down. But I just reached a limit that I could not push through today. I am going to the GP today for an appointment, as I need some support. But, I do not know how to handle this matter at work. We are a very small team, and for some reason, there is a reluctance to hire. Senior management know that if one of us has a funeral to attend, we are understaffed, and have to push back on work. This is freely known. There does not seem to be any room for unexpected leave. If I took time off, I will push more work onto others. The CFO will ask if I am better on Monday, and I have no answer for this question. I will not be better for a while (but know I will get there.) Has anyone been in this situation before and have any advice? Considering the following context - if you admit that you are struggling, there is nothing that can practically be done to alleviate that in the short term (we are already understaffed, and hiring for a relatively niche role takes time); a fear that highlighting this issue will flag you as a potential ""liability"" or someone ""not coping"" in the company, and you have worked so hard to build your reputation there as being a reliable pair of hands. Thank you",2024-08-03 13:31:41,6,3,1,Positive,0.06952097505668935,0,0,2

I had a terrible breakup, covid was incredibly stressful, cost of living keeps rising exponentially, society is at a political crossroads that only seem to be worsening and the world seems like it is falling apart with all the war and global tension.

I’m finding myself to be really stressed lately. Frequent headaches, shakes, random hand sweats, muscle twitches, random bodily aches, ears have been bugging me as well with no sign of anything being wrong.

I’m perfect in terms of physical and overall health, blood is great, body is great. But emotionally, I’m not and it’s creating many problems for me.

The breakup was the only time I’ve been able to cry about something just by thinking of it and that’s coming from a person who never cries.

I find myself to not be breathing properly, instead subconsciously holding my breath or taking shallow fast breaths. I also find myself to subconsciously tense up for whatever reason.

I guess all I’m looking for are some words of reassurance, and advice from where to go here and how to improve myself.

This is my redefining for the term “whitelighting”, it can be understood as a form of interaction where an individual uses positive manipulation techniques to help someone who is experiencing anger, stress, or anxiety. Unlike “gaslighting,” which is generally recognized as a harmful form of manipulation aimed at creating doubt in someone’s perception of reality, “whitelighting” appears to be aimed at achieving a positive outcome — reducing stress and anxiety in another person.

1embwuz,careeradvice,Emotionally Abusive Boss,"Hi all- I am in need of some serious advice regarding my current position and work environment. I have been with the same logistics company for approximately 2.5 years now, and I would first like to recognize that the pay is decent and I am very good at what I do. I truly pride myself on my work ethic and ability to multitask and take on plenty at once. However, my boss is making it incredibly difficult to work here. Here are just a few things that my boss does that have profoundly impacted my ability to complete my tasks and lead a happy life:
- ﻿﻿We never know what version of him we will get each day. He often comes in irate (screaming, slamming things, and making very hurtful remarks to my coworkers and I), which automatically gives me anxiety. I have had full-on panic attacks at work resulting in me hiding in the bathroom unable to breathe.

﻿﻿- He has very clear favorites. More specifically, there is one woman that he refuses to reprimand or hold to the same standard as the rest of us. She is allowed to exceed her allowed time off, and makes numerous mistakes every day (all of which I have to fix). Her tasks are simply neglected, she is never expected to learn from her mistakes, and the burden is thrown onto me to ensure the job is done correctly and in a timely manner. When others have brought up her negligence and incompetence, he defends her and says that “she’s not going anywhere, so I don’t care.”


﻿﻿- We received a significant pay cut last year due to funds being low. I was absolutely understanding of this. However, despite low funds, he continues to hire new individuals who are not qualified for the job and often pays them more than those who have been here for years. The woman I previously mentioned (the favorite) has gotten multiple raises in the last year because she tells my boss she is going to leave as she is broke. Because of his uncanny obsession with her, he caves each time and she walks out with a higher pay.

﻿﻿- He makes very inappropriate comments to us all. Sexual comments, racist comments, hurtful remarks. You name it- he has done it.

- He makes personal digs at us all. You can tell he quite literally wants a reaction out of us for his entertainment. 


There are a plethora of other factors contributing to my unease and dissatisfaction with my job. I find it very hard to wake up in the morning and go to work. I often cry on my way to work. Over the last few months, I have lost over 30 pounds from the constant state of stress I am in. Each day, I have to assume the roll of multiple people, as no one is held to a standard, and excuses are constantly made. I have never felt so drained in my entire life, and unfortunately, this has started to impact my personal life as well. After being treated like a doormat at work, I often come home crying and anxious. The last thing I want is for this to impact my relationship with my fiance and family members. However, I am so scared to jump the gun and leave. I have been trying to find another position. Any & all help is appreciated.",2024-08-07 13:33:30,1,0,1,Positive,0.04392957351290684,0,0,2

17w9755,stress,Body aches from stress?,"

Yesterday I was extremely tense for long periods of time due to anxiety because one of my coworkers was sick and doesn't really do a good job of keeping it from spreading. I did my best to keep my distance and wore a mask and everything but sometimes he would get really close to me but I'd shuffle out of the way, and at some point he was told to go on my register while I went on break. Luckily I didn't have to spend much time at the register because it was self checkout, but there was no cleaning supplies at all so I would just use hand sanitizer whenever I had to touch it, which thankfully wasn't a ton because it was a slow night.

But the entire time, I was extremely tense and panicky, fists balled up, hunched over, etcetera, and was panicky when I got home and this morning.

But during my shift I had some body aches. And of course I started panicking. My mom said it was probably due to stress because of how tense I was. I'll admit I was a lot more tense than I usually am in situations like that. I took some Tylenol (though not enough), but I was still very panicked, and the more I panicked the worse it got, and I couldn't relax and the fact that I couldn't relax made me panic even more, but eventually I calmed down and it went away later, that was about six hours ago. Now they've just lightly come back, but I've felt fine other than that throughout the rest of the day, no cold symptoms or anything, in fact my nose has been clearer today than it was lately due to allergies. 

This has gotta be stress right? If so, how can I get rid of these?

1aybkib,stress,Feeling Overwhelmed?,"It takes more to overwhelm some people than others, but the feeling and the impact are the same: overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety  
  
Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again:  
  
Identify what you can and can’t control. List your issues in three columns: what you can control, what you can influence and what is out-with your control. For each item in the first two columns, reflect on how you would like that situation to be instead and what small step you can take to achieve that.  
  
Focus on solutions. Now that you have perspective on what you can and can’t control, and the end-point for each issue. Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions.  
  
Prioritise your actions. Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are. Firstly, deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues. As a general rule, deal with the important issues over the urgent issues: here-in lies the path to living sustainably crisis free.  
  
Communicate. With your plan in place, communicate with those who may be affected: it’s incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation.  
  
Eat well. Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or over-reliance on junk food. Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition you’ll need to play your best game.  
  
Gratitude. It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed. Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things you’re grateful for: that you’re taking control of challenging situations, that you’re on your way to calmer times, that you’re learning a lot about yourself, perhaps that others are supporting you.  
  
Blow off some steam. Exercise – whatever works best for you: a brisk walk, hit the weights, an hour on the bike – has a magical ability to burn off that #anxiety and re-set all those neurotransmitters. It will also help you get that good night’s #sleep  
  
Get your rest. Know that you’re focusing on your priorities with a clear plan. You’re pushing yourself hard through the day. A good night’s sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list.    
  
  
Celebrate your successes. Each step forward is worthy of celebration. Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward. Each success leads to further steps forward.  
  
  
  
Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with. Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us. Longer term however, it can be debilitating. Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things.

","Hey everyone, thanks for reading this, and please do reply with some suggestions because I’m really confused with this.

I'm Ayush Sagar, and I recently completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science (2019-2022). After graduation, I planned to pursue an MCA at a top college like an NIT, but I decided to gain some work experience first. I joined a pay-after-placement course where I learned DSA, Front-end, Backend, and prepared for placements. Fortunately, I landed a job as a Junior Software Engineer with a 4.03 LPA salary, starting in March 2023.

However, my time at the company was challenging. I joined a project that the team had been working on for months, and because I was new, I found it hard to connect with them. They often went on breaks together and kept each other updated, but I felt isolated and left out.

Before joining, I had informed HR and my supervisor that I needed 15 days of leave in April to visit my hometown, but they only approved 7 days, with no option to work from home. After returning, I was assigned backend tasks like creating APIs, but I received little guidance. I was confused about the project’s architecture, and when I asked my manager for help, I was directed to other engineers who often gave negative feedback about my performance.

Eventually, I was left without tasks and spent days watching courses. On May 9th, I was informed that my performance wasn’t meeting the company’s expectations, and since they needed someone who could work faster, they let me go. I was given the option to take a full-time experience letter or a 6-month internship letter, and I chose the internship letter. However, HR couldn’t adjust the dates, so I ended up with just 2 months and 9 days of experience.

Now, I’m facing a tough situation. In every interview, I’m asked why I left my previous company so early, and I struggle to answer. I’m worried that this short stint might hurt my chances of landing a new job, and I’m unsure whether I should show this experience or leave it out, which would create a gap on my resume.

Currently, I’m pursuing my MCA from VIT Bhopal (2024-26), but I’m still unsure how to handle this situation. Has anyone been in a similar spot, or does anyone have tips on how to address this in interviews? I’d really appreciate any guidance or suggestions.

Thanks in advance!",2024-08-06 20:20:24,1,2,1,Positive,0.013687657828282827,0,0,2

It all started with the promotion cycles at work and have gotten worse through interview prep to change jobs. I did get promoted and I did get a good job offer so everything is thankfully going well. The only thing is, I feel constantly stress, even after these processes ended. Numerous times a day, on a daily basis, I get a feeling that feels like my heart is being squeezed, and my stomach sinks. I don’t like this, and want to relax, and I’m worried about the other health consequences due to stress and anxiety, I just have no idea where to start and what to do. Therapy is definitely an option, but my finances are shaky at the moment, so I don’t know when I’ll be able to start therapy.

1bc0aet,stress,"Constant worry over nothing, stressing over small mistakes at work etc, nonstop. How to deal with it?","I'm so tired of worrying, stressing, grieving, but I can't stop. I'm doing all the self care tips (walking, which I love anyway, diet, I never drink or smoke etc, laughing/doing fun hobbies/enjoying stuff, cuddling my cats, exercise) - but my head is still always churning and worrying.

I'll worry over the most stupid shit too. Like, I'll watch something I enjoy on TV/Youtube or whatever, and in the back of my head, I'm worrying about like...lunch? I'll be churning like ""dont forget you should make lunch soon. Dont forget, you need to remember to make lunch before work."" etc. Doesn't matter if I set an alarm to try and let my head ""forget"" - it doesn't help.

Or even on my days off, if I'm playing a videogame, I'm constantly looking at the watch, like ""you've played for 30 minutes, you should remember to keep time. You need to remember to look at the time again soon."" Just fucking non stop.

Or I will make a human error at work, but it upsets people (upsets guests, customers etc), and my coworkers get annoyed, even if I only make mistakes like ....less than 5 times a year or something , it burns me to the ground every time. And every time I make a mistake, I start worrying and stressing and feeling like shit for months, just spiraling because it made someone's day shit for like 2 whole minutes. I lose sleep, I have nightmares about it, and I just cant let it go.

I'll worry about ""did i remember XYZ at work?"" when I'm at home, and when I'm at work, I'll worry about like ""omg I should have watered the plants last week, what if they die, what if its too late."" 

Like, I KNOW its stupid, I can catch myself thinking these things and I know it's just, like, okay? Then throw the damn plant in the trash, it's not the end of the world, but my mind is constantly like flogging me over all these things. Even now just writing this, I'm constantly looking at the time cause I need to make sure I have time for everything (lunch...) before I go to work, where I made a minor error yesterday, and people got upset. (my co workers made many mistakes last week and obviously i dont nag anyone about it. and my co workers are not bad, just that they need to nitpick and blame people when mistakes are made.)

I feel like I'm getting brain damage from all this worry, I just cant stop spinning my wheels. 

I've always been a little bit ""worried"" (a sort of keeping on your toes?) but these last years I've had to deal with some shit, grief, new grief on top of grief, overworked, burn out at work, no one to help me with anything, etc and I guess I just cant get back on track. Like, I legit miss being able to just think ""fuck it"" at a work place, ya know? Now, it's like, if I dont do everything 100% correct all the time, the whole place falls apart, and there's no one there that manages to keep it quite together like I do (even if I make mistakes). 

How on earth does one go about resetting our stress back to a default? Any good tips, videos? I need something before I'm back to maintaining it with walks and such. 

I feel like, obviously its not normal to feel like you're buzzing with stress at any given time. Even my most relaxing things (videogames, walking) is like, I cant unwind with it, because I'm stressed as hell.",2024-03-11 10:45:18,5,4,1,Negative,-0.042669340463458105,0,0,0

19eftxc,stress,Stress is how I live my life and I think it’s taking a toll on my body. (Sick all the time) how do I get by?,"I think a combination of work, master classes, low financial income, high bills, chronic Asthma, and birth control causing  constant bleeding is making me sick all the time.I also have low vitamins D so that doesn’t help.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I am 28 and I honestly feel so much older. My body just doesn’t know how to function at a normal level anymore. I can feel myself breaking down. I know everyone has stress in their life so I’m not trying to say my stress is more than others…I just feel like I have a particular combination of negatives That is really driving me down…

I don’t know how to alleviate my stress… I love my job! I absolutely wouldn’t change it for anything but it is very demanding mentally, I am getting my masters in the field to progress in the field, and have some  financial success as well.  However I’m constantly being expose to germs and clearly my body can’t handle it.

I had so many snow days last week and as soon as I go back to work just for two days I get sneezed on …peed on, coughed on etc…. Now I’m sick.

Right now this year I made maybe 15-20k….. and it’s not like I don’t have bills I do. So much so that I have racked up 10k in credit cards just to get by….

I know I should crack down on some going out to eat and going out with friends but these things are what offer the few moments of relief I have from the grind and it’s hard to give it up. I have already starting using an app to track my spending….

My masters classes are going well but also cause me an insane amount of stress.

I have dealt with asthma since childhood. As an Adult tried Steroids but Couldn’t afford them anymore. That helped alleviate my use of the pump. But I still have at least one attack a month. 

I have tried several BC methods and other than a cyst on my ovaries have no other reason to be bleeding heavily… I would go back for another sonogram but I can’t financially afford it right now. The last one cost me $700 even after insurance. I can’t just stop the BC because I want that extra measure of protection. But my body seems to suffer from this. Right now I’ve been bleeding for a month straight, and heavy, with so much pain.

You know how in life there are steps you can take to alleviate stress…. I don’t feel like I have anyway to alleviate mine. I can’t talk to anyone…or at least not anyone too much before they’ll stop listening or worry about their one stress and not have time for mine….

I can’t seem to find more immediate ways to alleviate my stress other then thinking about my future career that will at least financially alleviate some stress, but that still about a year or more away.

What are some of your ways you alleviate stress?",2024-01-24 12:20:09,7,4,1,Positive,0.025512587610801888,0,0,2

1el8quc,careeradvice,I’m scared for my career. How do I course correct before it’s too late?,"I \[20F\] am about to begin my junior year as an informatics major. I enjoy it, but the major is small in my university, and I’ve found it to be worryingly easy so far. I see all my friends with different majors learning things and stressing over assignments, while I don’t feel like I’ve learned much at all. This worries me, especially since UX/UI (my chosen concentration) seems to be pretty portfolio-based. I’m scared that I’ll reach the end of college SOL without a job lined up. If I’m on the wrong track for my career, I want to know so I can course correct ASAP before it’s too late.

My options:

1. Work on my career/portfolio outside of classes. I took an introductory web design class abroad last semester and really enjoyed it, so I’m thinking of independently studying HTML/CSS/Javascript.
2. Minor in something. I started to minor in CS, but I found it boring & frustrating. When I tried my hand at data science, I felt the same way. I think backend technology frustrates me because it feels too abstract due to the lack of visual feedback. I don’t know if it’s not for me or if I’m just lazy and need to push through it.
3. Switch my major/start a double major ASAP. I enjoy art and psychology, but as my main concern here is job security, I don’t think those are good options. If I were to choose this route, I’d probably go for accounting, as both of my parents are accountants. I’m also fairly charismatic, so I could try insurance or sales. If so, how would I break into that?

My goals:

1. Most importantly: Job security. I don’t want to be up the creek without a paddle. I want financial security with a good work/life balance (don’t we all)?
2. Ideally, I’d love to travel internationally for my job. That’s partially why I'm considering changing my major. I know being a digital nomad as a web designer is possible, but it’s hard to pull off from what I’ve heard.

1emjcci,careeradvice,Advice on Adjusting Job Titles for Resume and LinkedIn: How to Handle Discrepancies?,"Hi everyone,

I’m seeking some advice on how to handle job titles on my resume and LinkedIn as I search for my next role.

* **Original Titles**:
   * Project Coordinator for my first role
   * Project Manager for my second role
* **Adjusted Titles**:
   * Project Manager for my first role
   * Program Manager for my second role

I made these adjustments because I believe the roles I performed were more aligned with these higher-level titles. However, I’m concerned about potential issues, especially with reference and background checks due to these changes.

Specifically, I’m worried about:

* How significant the difference in titles might be during background checks.
* Whether it’s better to stick with the official titles or use the adjusted ones.
* How to effectively explain these adjustments if questioned by potential employers.

Has anyone faced a similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice on the best way to navigate this issue would be greatly appreciated!

1en4y1n,careeradvice,Heartbroken,"Hello all, I am a postgraduate from Kedge Business School in International Business and did my internship in Horticulture industry in Market Research. After covid happened, I returned back to my hometown and in Jan 2022 started working for a recruiting firm as a TA. Even though, I didn't like it one bit and I only did it just for the sake of earning. Turns out, I'm somewhat good in my job (a monkey can do it) even though I hate it entirely. Now after restructuring and for the peace of my mind, I had to resign. I had been quite interested in Product Management and did buy books to learn and upskill. Even lied on my CV just to get interview calls but I usually get rejected or ghosted. I even learned SQL and Advanced Excel. But the results are the same. This has taken a mental toll, I do have an offer from a recruiting firm but I'm a little worried. How should I navigate from this? What shall be the best course of action?

  
I have a huge passion for travel, learning languages, playing video games, sports to name a few but I do have an inferiority complex and an ego. All of my friends are somewhat doing better than me and I feel like I'm way behind them. 

  
I have never been a winner. Everything was handed out like I never really achieved anything beyond schooling. Sometimes dying seems like an option but I love my mother so I would never.

  
I look forward to your suggestions and advice. Thank you

1c8d1qt,students,please help me pick ASAP- mac or utm?,"i am completely utterly torn between these two canadian universities— mcmaster and uoft (mississauga campus). i am a hs senior currently and i have to decide super soon and i really need some advice.

i was accepted to utm for the psych bachelor of science program and the socsci program at mac (hoping to get into pnd year 2). i live about 30 mins from utm and about an hour and a bit from mac, but either way id be living on campus for both, 1st year. also, cost-wise i am set for both options. with lots of research i came to a conclusion that both programs are equal good academically. however, socially i am struggling to pick, my mind is at uoft, but my heart is at mac. i created pros and cons lists for both schools and im still torn. 

MAC:
pros: 
-i feel like i will be much happier
-beautiful campus
-i love the social environment and community 
-as a dancer, there are plenty of opportunities for me to join dance teams or keep it in my life
-make tons of new friends, have a fresh new start
-have a good balance of social and academic 
-as i have prominent mental health issues, i know i am entitled to accommodations which i had throughout hs and helped me a lot mentally
-much more freedom
-from what i heard internships or hands on opportunities 

cons:
-not sure if the pnb program has a good mix between the sciences and arts (i love sciences, however, i’d like a balance between science based courses and art based), also the general psych is not eligible for grad school from what i’ve heard
-graduating with a B.A (not sure if that restricts opportunities for grad school)
-super drastic change, having to leave EVERYTHING behind
-have to quit the job that i have so much heart and passion for (im a dance teacher)
-worried i may not take care of myself the best, even though im pretty independent but  due to mental health i have off days
-far from my family, friends, and bf, who each i would have to make more efforts to see (without a car)
-i’m not the strongest in math and im required to take 2 maths year 1, and 1 year too (i know stats is a year 2 requirement anywhere you go)

UTM:
pros: 
-graduating with BSC (may open more doors)
-i’m able to keep my job which brings me happiness 
-able to have my car, can go anywhere anytime— therefore freedom
-not may changes since im close to home
-can see family, friends, bf way more while hopefully making new friends
-tons of labs/experiments, good mix with the arts
-wont have to gamble my major (i know i will be in BSC psych, whereas, mac i have to get into pnb)

CONS:
-i’m not a fan of the competitive environment, or vibes of the campus 
-rumoured to be harder academically, i don’t want to suffer
-i won’t be able to branch off to neurosci if i chose too as i am missing prereqs
-didn’t feel like i fit in on that campus
-stay at my job and may get wayyy more attached
-scared my opportunities for dance may be limited
-i feel i might suffer socially, and lose the balance between social and academic which is important to me

both schools enviably have their pros and cons but im just not sure what to do because when one school has something the other contradicts it. please help.",2024-04-20 00:52:09,1,2,1,Positive,0.21789226855016328,0,0,2

1eqde1l,careeradvice,Considering dropping out of sustainability master's,"Hi!

I guess I'm posting because, like a lot of people, I'm unsure of how to proceed with my career and would greatly appreciate the wisdom of others' experience.

It's been my life dream to do meaningful sustainability research either as a researcher or professor. In pursuit of this dream, I applied and was accepted to a top master's sustainability program at a top 5 research university.

The thing is... maybe a little too late... **I'm realizing/starting to have extreme doubts about the job prospects that will be available to me in sustainability.** It's a small, overpopulated field, and I know professorships are already hard to get in less competitive fields. It seems like in sustainability, I'd have to sacrifice so much for the small *chance* of being able to become a researcher. What if that sacrifice is for nothing?

Also, the more I've been thinking about it, I'm not really sure research would be my thing, either. I'm not sure I would want to be in the academic pressure-cooker for the rest of my life.

**I'm kind of thanking my lucky stars that I finished undergrad with another major in Econ, because I'm seriously considering switching tracks now.**

I was thinking I could aim to pivot into business sustainability, and avoid sustainability academia that way, but even with this, it seems like the entry-level business sustainability jobs are in big cities that I wouldn't be willing to move to. (Not a big city person.)

Having (tentatively) ruled out academic sustainability and business sustainability, **I was thinking I could just totally lean into economics/busines**s. Maybe once I get past the entry-level stage I could come back to business sustainability and not have to live in a big city (?).

So here I am, looking for government econ-related jobs and am strongly, *strongly* considering dropping out of my sustainability master's if I land a job.

**If I could get any concrete advice, it would be to ask- what do you think about dropping out of a sustainability master's program that I've been accepted to, given that I'm seriously considering switching tracks?**

I wish you all luck in this trying time <3",2024-08-12 13:13:12,1,0,1,Positive,0.11080086580086579,0,0,2

Hi there, I interviewed for a Postdoc position about two weeks ago. I thought the interview went well, and the research in the lab is perfect for my interests and skill set. The professor and I seemed to get along very well and at the end of the interview he said ""Well you seem great and you'll be hearing from me soon. I just have to get through all these other interviews."" He was hiring two post docs, and the positions have a lot of applications (100+), so I said ""I look forward to that, and good luck with the other interviews I know you have a lot to get through"". 

It has been over two weeks since then and I still have not heard back. I'm chalking it up to the fact that he is doing the interviews himself on top of running a lab, and just hasn't gotten through all of them yet, but I'm still worried. This is an ideal position compared to the other ones I am interviewing for. My question is: should I follow up with the professor or will that come off as desperate/unprofessional?

Self-reflection and motivation are crucial for enhancing mental health. Self-reflection allows individuals to examine and modify their thoughts and behaviors, leading to reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety. Motivation, particularly when intrinsic, enhances self-concept and emotional well-being. Neuroscientific research supports these effects, showing that such mental activities can alter brain structures involved in emotional regulation and self-control through neuroplasticity.

A friend recommended it to me because the field is broad—you study graphic design, photography, filmmaking, and more.

A year later, I (20F) got enrolled and have been studying Multimedia for two semesters. However, I’m not as satisfied as I thought I would be. Don't get me wrong, I would recommend this university to anyone. Most of the teachers are here to help you with anything, the program and activities are great, and the campus is beautiful. I've made many friends and we meet once in two weeks at a bar.

However, the downside is that I've been struggling with most of the subjects. I failed two classes in the first semester and managed again in the second. I've been feeling lost, especially since many of my classmates are better than me. I’m also unsure about what I want to do after I finish my degree and overall future.

Lately, I've been considering switching to a different college to become a social worker. But I'm worried and I have so many doubts. Have I wasted a year of hard work for nothing? Am I letting down my younger self, who dreamed of attending this university? What about my friends—will I still be part of the group if I leave?

Many people have reached out to me, wishing they could study Multimedia. Am I being ungrateful for wanting to leave when others would do anything to study here? This field offers many opportunities, and I’m scared that I'm throwing everything away to become a social worker, a job that doesn't pay much. All my immigrant parents wished for is me to study a college and get a high payed job, but I feel like I am disappointing them with this decision and I’m even more afraid to disappoint myself.

I (29 M) need help making a decision, I've been working at the same place for a couple of years and since I joined the company there was a girl (26 F)who started at the same job from the beginning, we weren't friends but we've worked together and we haven't had any problems until now.

A few months ago our manager (M) was moved to another team, and they put a new manager in his place (F) and we found out that this happened because the director (F) is a friend of my new manager, so the director decided that her friend was going to be our manager.

After changing managers my colleague and I were basically promoted to the same position, the main problem is that I've seen my colleague doing things just to benefit herself without considering the needs of the team and she doesn't even care about them.

Recently she even started stealing some of my ideas and implemented them when I was on PTO, I noticed that she started stealing my ideas when the directors and other managers recognized my initiatives as they have had a huge positive impact on the team, obviously the last one she stole hasn't worked or helped the team at all because she only stole the idea but not how I was going to implement it.

She also started giving bad advice to our new boss and gained her trust to the point of making her believe that she is her friend, but only to get what she wants, based on that bad advice, the rest of our colleagues started questioning her decisions and didn't agree with most of our boss's decisions, thanks to that most of my colleagues started getting more work and even some of them are exhausted and very stressed, I have tried to point out to them how to help the team and the problems that could arise in the long run due to these decisions but they just don't care and don't want to do anything.

Another thing is that my boss makes us do her job and basically make the decision that she should make, and since in our job most of my coworkers are men, both of them have this toxic idea that if you are not on her side you are against women and you can't do anything.

This month we both will get a raise for our good performance (basically thanks to me), but to be honest I'm not sure if I should stay in the same job with all these problems, with my coworker trying to steal everything from me, my manager not caring about anything, the director being friends with her and also ignoring the problems and making the team more stressed and having bad results.

I have applied for other positions in the same company but I haven't had any luck, do you think I should keep trying and change to another position? Or stay and get the raise and promotion because other managers have noticed my work and I basically have the recognition of my coworkers?",2024-08-07 00:51:03,1,0,1,Positive,0.06060606060606062,0,0,2

18eb4k3,stress,Long term recovery,"Hiya. I think the short story is that for the last few years, I've been trying to recover from severe burnout, that's left me with a host of cognitive and functional issues, as well as a severe depression (which has been with me on/off since my early 20ies) but has been getting progressively worse, and a permanent fixture in my head since around 2020.

It's been a long hard road of cleaning up my life - and most of my resources has been spent ""future proofing"" my life (economy, health etc.) to the point where I feelt comfortable starting to look a bit ahead. 

My problem is that I'm realizing how much shit there still is to deal with, and I don't really know where or how to start. I'm still kinda overwhelmed and I have no idea how to gather the kind of momentum I know I'll need.

So I was hoping for suggestions for tools that might help. What tools did you use to sustain long term planning and energy management?",2023-12-09 10:52:59,4,2,1,Positive,0.025462962962962955,0,0,2

1elgfrw,university,"I'm thinking about taking a leave year or dropping out, any advice?","I'll try to keep this as short as possible. I (20 F) have started attending university two years ago and now will be starting my third year in my four year program. Unlike most, I got lucky and manage to attend my university for free, my countrys goverment pays for it, but if I drop out I will have to return the money, which was already spent on it (aproximetly 5000€). 

Since last summer I have started working to gain more money, cause my family doesn't come from a very wealthy background and my mom was currently the only one working at the time. Sadly, I got a job in a grocery store, which even though payed well, would often clash with my free time and classes.

This has lead me to fail a good number of my classes, to the point at which I would probably be kikcked out from university if I don't get my grades up. Now, I' m starting to wonder if higher education is even worth it and I'm not sure what I should do. I even started going to therapy at the begining of the year since I wasn't sure what to do because I really like the field I'm studying and didn't wanna drop out, but felt a lot of stress and pressure do to my classes.

What worrys me the most is how the people closest to me will react. I know my family loves me and they would definetly not throw me out to the street. They will certanly still be angry with me, which sucks since I'm a very nonconfrontational person, but they are. I also worry, that I will lose the friends I made in my studies, since we would not be attending in the same year. 

I genuanly don't know what to do, so I'm hoping someone here has any advice for me.

1e3zr2k,stress,Headaches after a hit,"Hi,

Three weeks ago, my friend accidentally hit me on the forehead with their palm (not their fist). The hit was not very strong but not very soft either; I'd say it had the force of a push. 

Since then:

1. I did blood tests, and the results were good.
2. I am exercising regularly.
3. I do neck exercises and apply cold/warm compresses on my neck.

Symptoms: For the past two months, my only symptom has been an annoying mild headache that lasts all day (even from the time I wake up). It can become more intense after work, maybe once per week. Additionally, I had a few severe headaches (only 2-3 times these two months), but I used to experience headaches once every two weeks even in the past. The difference now is this constant mild ""heaviness,"" which sometimes becomes more intense. Because it's constant, it affects my mood, as I can't fully relax mentally. My neck is sore but does not hurt.

Guesses:

1. Since my doctors said this is not a concussion, and after learning that even a hit from an Olympic boxer isn't enough to cause a concussion, I started thinking about my neck. However, my neck didn't really move to cause whiplash, so maybe it's a normal neck injury?
2. My second guess is that this could be psychological. When I am calm, the pain fades away (but not completely), and my mood improves. My work is usually stressful, and I have been working hard these past months, so burnout could be an option (even though I like my work).

My hope is to understand what's going on with my body, in order to be able to take the right steps. Any useful feedback is more than welcomed. Thanks in advance :)",2024-07-15 16:52:17,4,0,1,Positive,0.0873024594453166,0,0,2

Due to a cancellation I had my internal project catch up call, the evening before the clients morning meeting. The project catch up consisted of the developer and my manager, regarding the softwares feature rollouts for this sprint. We were raising clarifications, queries, amendments of timelines etc. 

The call finished up with 20 minutes left in the workday meaning I’ll be working this evening and tonight to prepare everything for first thing. My manager said “Get those actions out to the developer by COB” and they had spent the whole time doing nothing and have really taken a back seat in everything. 

I simply said “I’m sorry I’m not going to have time to do that because I need to prep for the 9am now.” She then said “Fine I’ll do it myself then, it will only take a second” in a very annoyed tone.

1c8pmxq,stress,I’m completely lost and hopeless especially financially,"I have a wife and 5 year old daughter yet with another on the way. My wife doesn’t work so the responsibility of providing is falling on my shoulders. 
I feel like a complete failure is life when it comes to my financial situation. I quit a job of 11 years. I always felt like an imposter doing what I was doing and felt like the company didn’t value me.  I left that job to go to another company in the same industry with the hopes of making more money. It was solely a sales job. The company culture was completely toxic and I hated everyone I was working with. It was a  medical equipment sales job. The vast majority of people I worked with were completely immoral and would do or say anything to get a sale. Needless to say it was a spectacular failure for me.
After that I went back to work for my family business, making far less money and working more hours than I ever had. I was promised more money and a better life, but it never materialized. I feel like I was told what ever I was needed to be told just to provide some relief for my father. 
We have no savings and are living paycheck to paycheck. 
I’ve always dealt with severe anxiety that has been like a wall preventing me from being productive. It’s been a real problem my whole life. In also constantly building fantasy worlds in my head to escape and I’ve done this forever.  Now my anxiety and depression are at levels they have never been at. I don’t know what to do. I’m sad and my thoughts are really running wild. I have more in my life than most, but was never able to get it together financially. I feel like I’ve utterly screwed myself and my family. I’m also making my wife miserable and it’s only a matter of time before my daughter realizes that I’m a loser. I don’t want to traumatize her. 
At this point in my life I should be more established but I’m always starting over with nothing. I recently lost my mother who was my sounding board so I feel like I have nobody to turn to. 
I started looking for new jobs for a new opportunity but I don’t know how my family (that I work with) will take it. I’m even considering moving out of state. The cost of housing and the cost of living in NY/CT area is out of control and I don’t think I can make it here. 
I’m lost and I don’t know where to turn. 
I know this is a rambling post but this is pretty representative of what goes on in my head all the time. 
Looking for any bit of light.

I sleep late at night and wake up late in the morning. After I wake up my mind constantly reminds me that Im a fuckin loser and I dont have job and have no money. My sleep schedule is messed up right now. I can wake up whole night without even feel being sleepy.

I go to the gym every day but I feel more and more sad when I see happy couple every day. I see dude just enjoying their life taking supplements and bulking up. Getting body of their dream and have no worries about money/job like me. And here I am struggling to find a decend earning job. I regret many of my decisions right after 2022. My family is in financial stress. My father had taken loans from many of his friends. I can't even request anything from my father. I feel ashamed even When I ask for money for my haircut. I feel I'm useless human and have nothing useful. From past 3 months I've been day dreaming of what i wish to become and earn money. But I know these are just my thoughts and would not be able to achieve 1% of it.

In 2021, I did a Wed dev bootcamp from Udemy and I dream about working for a Western company (im from asia) which would pay high salaries like $100k+ and I would solve all my family problems, but I couldn't. I graduated in 2022 with cs degree. I involed in bad habbits after my college and ruined my life with my own hands. I became addictive to social media and online games. I wasted my precious hours scrolling and playing in front of computer screen. I feel like I'm the only Idiot on earth. All my friends are earning more than my father, and here I'm dependent on my father. I feel soo soo fucking bad. I actually don't think about anything else But constantly remind myself of my unemployement. Even when I wish to talk to a girl I was reminded myself that Im fuckin broke and unemployed. No girl would even bother to waste their time for a useless unemployed man. 

From past few months Im learning web dev again, but this time I'm focusing more on ecommerce dev. I struggle to focus sometimes and I still get lost between the lectures. Idk what to do guys. I am so desperate that I'm ready to work for minimum salary but idk if any company would like to even recruit and waste their time to on me. I always feel I'm the worst and there are millions of people who are better than me. I sometimes forget the easiest of solution to a problem. I feel ashamed of myself. 

I set a goal for the month of may, I want to find a job and earn money asap and help my family. I have never thought getting a job would be this much difficult. What you guys think I should do now??

1eldbk0,stress,Stress at work,"I am new to this so any advice is welcome.

I have been at this company for little over 12 years.i like my job and up until this year i had a great manager.
Higher management decided to move things around and move my manager to another department, in return they promoted a gig in our department to be manager.
He is qualified on paper but not management material.
It has been noticed by few people that he feels threatened by the knowledge I have in the department and his actions seem like he’s trying to tear me down, over load me etc.

He is very corporate and will do anything higher management ask without thought.
This guy literally had 7-8 months off for stress and break down he only came back 4 months before being given this new role, my old manager even admitted to me that on paper he was the best person for the job and other people were worried to give him the job.

I had spoke to him and HR regarding stress and over works and it wasn’t took seriously, this is a company that says mental health is important.

Around a month ago, I came back from week holiday and had a121 with him, I told him o had too much on and can’t do other aspects of the role anymore due to the added worked. He the. Proceeded in giving me another project to work on.
Fast forward 2 weeks and I am sat at home having heart attack symptoms from stress and anxiety that the doctor then signed me off work for 2 weeks.
This ended tomorrow and I am In turmoil what to do. I feel like I should go back because all I can think of is the work added up and the stress on the other members of the team ( I am the main point of call for everything)but then I think am I ready to go back and am I actually more relaxed? All I been thinking about while off is work so I don’t actually feel any better.

My head is arguing with my heart.

I have a doctors call tomorrow morning to see how I am and if I need any more time off and I just don’t know what to do.

I like my job so it is horrible being off, I haven’t been off sick for around 4 years so it’s quite hard.

I also find it very hard to relax, I am not sure I know how to not be stressed. 

Update: doctor ended up giving me another month off work, first week and bit I struggled to not think about work, I was checking my emails and speaking to people from work. Now…. I have spoken to someone and they mentioned meditation, I have now incorporated meditation to my daily routine and visualisation. And it has helped me loads! And I haven’t checked my emails since.

1emqdhy,careeradvice,"I (22M) recently gradated college, and I feel completely stuck","**OP, you're a living stereotype!**

An extremely unremarkable position to be in, to be sure! But I am feeling quite a bit of anxiety and hopelessness, and it's still a tough position to be in. I'll try not to give away too many personal details

I live in the Central Valley in California and recently graduated college with a B.S. in History & Political Studies. My college was a small liberal arts college in a rural area, and I wish I had gone to a different school. I feel like I squandered the chance to meet with better opportunities because of that

(I still feel like it was meaningful and valuable! But not economically, unfortunately)

I'm currently trying to find a job now - ANYTHING - but my problem is that I literally have zero experience or skills

Okay, that's not *entirely* true: I was a cashier at a friend's gas station for a few months and I wrote and sometimes designed the layout for my college's student newspaper. And I'm very good at academic writing, and maybe a few other things, but that's it. I have no other skills to speak of

So I've been low-key panicking because I feel like it will be very difficult to develop a career I want from what feels like basically zero. Most available jobs in my area are either highly specialized technical jobs or minimum-wage dead-end jobs in retail

I'll get a retail job if I have to! But it feels like I can't even get into a job like this without some of the relevant experience - and if I do, I feel like it would be very easy to stay stuck there forever. And I hear that retail jobs are often pretty terrible, but I'll do it if I really have to

**What kind of career do you want, OP?**

As for my career, I'm not entirely sure what to do. In my senior year I decided I'd try and work my way into a Master's in International Relations and then get into the Foreign Service, but that's insanely difficult to do, and recently I learned I probably wouldn't enjoy all the traveling, anyway

Now I'm considering something in public policy - related, of course, but it seems like it's best to have fairly specific professional goals and some work experience before getting a Master of Public Policy. The Congressional Research Service stands out to me. I've always found their reports super helpful when wanting to learn about stuff, anyway

Unfortunately, my city's internship program is only for current students. I have yet to apply to internships from my various representatives, but I'm a bit pessimistic about my prospects given what I explained above. Other than these internships, I have no idea what else I could do

**What about your present situation?**

Thankfully I'm able to live with my parents for now and don't have to worry about housing or living expenses. I also sent my resume and some cover letters to a career services person from my college. She said she'd give feedback and I'm waiting on her response so I can start applying - she hasn't responded yet

**TL;DR:** I'm a recent college graduate with basically no skills or experience, and I kind of need to find a job soon. It's making me rather anxious. I'm also wondering how to gain relevant skills or experiences when all jobs expect that you already have these",2024-08-07 23:10:17,2,3,1,Positive,0.09133879113717824,0,0,2

 I'm not even sure if I'll get in, but if I do, I'm really worried about keeping up with the coursework and research. During my final year at my undergraduate, we had a 'mini thesis' research project to give us an idea of what a real thesis would look like. I had a terrible experience. Firstly, I think I was just not smart enough and I was under a lot of stress (my anxiety and depression was at an all time high) and my supervisor wasn't really nice. He gave lots of constructive criticism, which is good, but he wouldn't advise me on how I could make it better. For instance, he would tell me that my writing wasn't 'scientific enough' and when I asked how I could improve, or if there was a course or something I could take to learn, he would just say it wasn't necessary. 

The main thing I didn't like about university is that they just expect you to know how to do everything and I obviously didn't. I struggled a lot that year, and I still struggled to find work. I know that if I get in, I would be able to have access to applications that they don't usually put on public job posts, and that it might help in me finding better work. However, how will I manage if I struggled so much before? Any advice is much appreciated.",2024-06-28 14:39:35,3,0,1,Positive,0.16748015873015873,0,0,2

About 2 weeks ago, one of my lymph nodes swelled up to the size of a golf ball and then I started developing cold-like symptoms. Dealt with that for about a week and once it went away, I began a spell of vomiting where I threw up at least 14 times in one night before I stopped counting.

Every time I mention these symptoms to family members and friends, the first thing they ask is ""are you stressed?"" But I always answer ""I don't think so.""

I guess I DO have a lot on my plate right now but maybe I'm just subconsciously suppressing it. I sat down and started thinking about what things might be bothering me and I realized there actually are some significant things. 

1. Changes in my job which has me scared of being phased out

2. Ultimate dream of becoming a musician is making me scared because it's so much work and seems impossible to achieve

If you’ve done a semester/year abroad and loved it I would love to hear about your experience :)).
Some information about me:
-I am a Palestinian born and raised and I attend university there so it’s important for me to go to a country that isn’t racist to Palestinians/middle easterners. (I am white passing so I am more worried about racism from uni peers when they ask where I am from and not from randoms in the street).
-I don’t want to go to a country where I’ll end up struggling to communicate with it’s citizens. (I can speak English, Arabic and Hebrew fluently and a little German and Turkish). 
-I’m fortunate enough to have traveled a lot in my life and Ive been to most countries in Europe, Jordan, Egypt and the USA (a couple of times) and my favorite places were northern Italy, Barcelona, Germany and Scotland (but I am not sure if being there as a student and not a tourist will be as good).
-I have celiac (meaning I can’t eat gluten) so I need a country that has easily accessible gluten free options! 
If you have a recommendation for a specific uni that youve been to and enjoyed, please share it with me!

1erdn9z,college,How much credibility do grad programs give to self-studied topics?,"Once you have already been admitted to a graduate program and say have your first semester grades to demonstrate good progress, how much credibility/recognition will the program give to material you have self-studied? I don’t mean getting credit for it (though I know some programs do allow you to register for independent study credits), but rather citing it to get into more advanced classes. 

For example, say a class I want to take requires Math310 as a prerequisite and I have taken a lot of other Math classes at that level but specifically self-studied this prereq class. Will I be allowed to bypass such a prereq? Another example, if a class has a masters version and a doctorate version, but I self studied the material at around the masters level already, can I cite that to get into the doctorate level class?

I know this would depend on the specifics and who my advisor is. But I feel like when you’re already in grad school, you’ve kinda proven yourself capable of understanding complex ideas. And in a PhD program, a lot of what you study is on your own anyway (with some supervision/guidance). So grad students ought to be given more “benefit of the doubt” so to speak when compared to undergrads. I’m asking because I’ve been self studying a lot of graduate topics that over the summer and while I definitely dont expect to get credit for them, I wouldn’t want to be forced to take classes on material that I already know.

I am about to start my first semester, teaching as a tenure track professor. I also recently found out that I was expecting my third child due mid April. Our spring semester ends at the end of April going into the first week of May. 

I am very nervous about telling my department head that I am pregnant, primarily because I am the only woman in the department, there are generational differences, and racial and ethnic differences (he’s an older white man and I’m a younger Black woman). He also doesn’t have children and isn’t the biggest fan of children. 

I would like some advice on how to break this to him. Additionally, strategies on handling the last two weeks of the spring semester. I would like to go online and asynchronous. I feel like this would inconvenience my colleagues the least Compared to having them take over for my classes for the last two weeks. 

My university does have maternity leave even if you haven’t been there for a full year. I would get six weeks but I might not need this considering I am on a nine month contract. 

I’m in the U.S.

Thanks in advance!

1d8g3lk,university,FRANCE: HELP ME DECIDE MY FUTURE BY PICKING A UNIVERSITY,"Heyy, i'm a senior in high school studying in a french school abroad. As such, my admission process went through Parcoursup.

I basically got every offer I most wanted. I'm ecstatic and extremely grateful for that, but I'm now struggling to pick. Here's my situation:

I have an admission offer from Sciences Po Paris, as well as an offer from prepa ECG at Henri IV with and without internat.

In addition, I'm in the waitlist for a double bachelor's at Paris-Dauphine for science des organisations and artificial intelligence. I'm 18th on the list, so I should get an admission offer in the following two days.

For those who arent familiar with how admissions work through Parcoursup, one you get offers, you have about two days to choose only one. You can still keep your waitlists. As of now, I have till tomorrow night to pick between Sciences Po and Henri IV, all the while still keeping Paris-Dauphine in my waitlist.

For context, I'm interested in economis and finance at the moment. I also think I want to do my master's elsewhere than in France (I'm thinking the UK amongst other options), probably in the subjects mentioned above.

I'm aware that the program in Paris-Dauphine seems more in line with my current and future interests, but it also seems wrong to say no to an offer from Sciences Po Paris considering its prestige and the connections it builds. Similarly, a CPGE in Henri IV doesn't seem like a good idea considering I might want to do my masters elsewhere than a french Grande Ecole, but it hurts to say no to such a one in a lifetime offer.

I desperately need your experience, expertise and general advice and I need it quick, because I feel like no matter what I choose I'll feel a little regret over abandoning the rest of the options.",2024-06-05 03:18:22,1,0,0,Positive,0.03860119047619048,0,0,2

1el0sa9,students,DO NOT WORK FOR THE DOE OMNI ALLIANCE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM!!!,"Please do not work for this internship program! 
I worked for this internship program recently and guess what they are a big fuck over to everyone who works for them. They paired me with a mentor who wasn’t even present throughout the internship taking a vacation or leave in a different state or country the first two weeks of the internship. She wasn’t even responding to any of my emails even when she did email and I would respond back within 2 minutes nothing nada no response for hours DAYS!!!! She even fucked me over with my research project that was made into a poster. She kept giving it back to me five days before it was due. 

KEEP IN MIND THIS TIMELINE HERE IS WITHIN A TIME SPAND OF 10 or 11 DAYS. 

She kept telling me no this needs to be change this needs to be taken out. I did what she wanted and kept giving it back to her trying to professional state my opinion of my work but noo she kept telling me no without respect. I ended up missing the deadline to submit my poster for printing. She didn’t even want to accept the poster the way I was giving it to her with the edits she was asking for. She was telling me noo the text needs to be shorter more concise. The graphics need to be more simplistic. It ended up being a complete shit show of a poster too fucking simple. The internship email me asking wtf is up why is my poster not submitted and I told them its my mentor she wanted it that way and I had no choice. Then the told my mentor what haven’t I submitted yet. I got another email from my mentor she just said submit it and I was like wait what about the layout of the poster its all unorganized and what about the important graphics but noo she said submit it the way it is so I did. A day or two goes by I get an email from the internship guess what my poster was rejected not approved for printing because the so called “content” of it not meeting the amount of work done. So I’m mad and I emailing everyone from the internship to my mentor like I did the work its not on me its on her she had to be wanting it simple the way she wanted she told submit it like that. Then she implusively changes the poster and resubmits it without me knowing then later tells me in an email that she worked on it and resubmitted it. I take a look a the poster and everything about it is not the work I had done she went in a complete opposite direction. She made it even more simple!!!! Just three sentences and a lot of graphics without captions of what it is demonstrating no references cited no next steps no results. While all of this is happening I am getting my ass chew out for not submitting the poster in time to having to come to a conclusion of printing it myself for the conference. After this I tried tried tried to ask the people who are reviewing the poster to get their approvals so they print it in time. No response nothing I was also not getting any response from my mentor as well because the internship was telling me to contact my mentor for help contact her for her to email the people I had already email to expedite approvals for printing. I finally get an email from her and she tells me were waiting on a divison approval then we just need two more and then it can be printed. I am like okay I’ll keep checking I still wanted to make sure it will be approved to be printed I am still emailing people. I am still trying. 

Then my weekly meeting with my mentor rolls around and her audio fucking sucks I can’t even hear her let alone she can’t hear me. She tells me she did not get my research paper findings of what she told me to get done that I actually got done within a day. She then tells me I want you to do more work more implemenation of a different software and show me the work because your poster and these weeks I have not seen work on implementation. WHAT!!!!!! Like what do you mean you haven’t seen work from me I been showing you the work I been emailing the work and telling you what I did. 

Then the conference rolls in and when its time for us interns to pick up our posters…… SHOCKER my poster is not there. The internship there at the conference tells me they should have pulled me out from the line of interns to directly get to me to give me my poster and make sure its printed and I got it. They were looking for it at the stack of posters everyone got theirs except me JUST ME AND ME ONLY. The internship then tells me were going to talk to these people who are the program managers who came to the conference. They straight up tell me there’s nothing they can do. They tell me contact your mentor contact the people who are approving your poster see how far it is and lets see if we can get it approved by 5 that way we can print it before the poster session. I am mad as hell right now the internship people couldn’t help me and my mentor isn’t even answering my emails or my calls. The people approving my poster still no response. i check on my poster approval its still stuck on division approval. I go back and tell them I can’t get in touch with anyone and its still waiting approvals. The slap to face was when they told me your mentor went on vacation VACATIONNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I am however thankful to guy of the internship program telling me its not my fault I did everything I could have done to get my poster printed. Its on my mentor and the people approving it. It isn’t right that my mentor thought it was not on her behalf to make sure my poster was printed and to tell me nothing could have been done. He then tells me look your here at this conference take advantage of it. Your not presenting because you don’t have a poster but network and have fun. 
Okay, the third day of the conference lets say close to 9PM. I get an email from my mentor saying your poster is approved now like its a good thing when I only have one more day at the conference and hello that was the day I was suppose to present. 


NOW WERE ONTO THE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM OF PEOPLE: 

They do not care about any of their interns. 
They do not care about any of the mentors either. 
They are very unorganized about their internship and on top of that THEY DO NOT RESPOND TO ANY OF THEIR EMAILS!!! IT WILL TAKE HOURS EVEN DAYS!!!!

They just email the mentors the whole supposed plan of the internship and how to interact with your mentee. The do not specify how the mentors’ engagement is crucial and to be present throughout the internship. 
They say one thing in an email then say another thing THEY DO NOT SPECIFIY OR MAKE A CLEAR STATEMENT. 

The seminars they say is a optional to what your mentor suggest you should go to and attend COMPLETE BULLSHIT. They sent out in another email saying its required its manadtory that you attend these seminars each one of them. 

Also, if you work remote with them don’t just don’t. They don’t give you instructions on the things they want you to fill out and complete its pretty much a figure it out I will not help you. 

Even when setting up that special login and getting into your created email address guess what there’s no fucking clue on how to get it done. Then later get bitch at for not completing it. 

The program managers their both karens. Complete bitches who are racists. They won’t help you even if you email or talk to them they give you the cold shoulder. They even fucked with out meal per diem. Throughout the internship it was these two karens who couldn’t communicate a simple understanding of what they wanted and expected the each intern to complete. They are the ones to blame for confusion of everything. 

One the last day of the conference the told us were not deducting the food served at the conference. When before they told us they were and that we had to spend $16 or $17 less on food that was served at the conference. PLUS even if we did or didn’t eat the food provided at the conference it was still deducted!!!!!


Us interns even said like hey many of us got sick here at the conference we got congested and had nasal issues where we had to miss some events even when it was just one. They did not care they said still were taking it out of your stipend and housing allowance for missing one event. 

Last but not least when filling out the expense report they told us prior keep your receipts of to and from the airport and home. So I did, when I got to the to and from airport/home there was no ground transportation expense or could even make one so we had to use the car mileage. The car mileage calculates point A to point B from point B to point A and automatically come up with a rate of reminbursment. But I got fucked over here they gave me back the expense report and told me were not approving this because it exceeds the rate. LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXCEEDS!! I was trying to make an expense for what you asked for that was only offered on the expense to put in there was nothing for gas or ground transportation. But yet I included the gas receipts because that is what you wanted from all of us. They told me is not being reimbursed its not being approved.  I told them like you wanted receipts of how we got to and from the airport/home nothing was told about car mileage.

1eoxhjh,college,I’m not sure I want to go back to college ,"For some context, I’m going into my second year studying engineering and so far it’s been rocky- I failed 2 summer courses (6 week spans) they were difficult classes especially to do in a short period of time so I’ve been trying to forgive myself.

I also realized I probably have some stuff going on mentally that isn’t making this any easier- I feel really embarrassed and behind now as well. 

I’m not enjoying my studies in practice but in theory I find it interesting enough to keep pursuing. 

I just feel beyond exhausted and the idea of going back to college literally makes me want to cry. I feel really scared and I also don’t really feel okay anymore- there’s a part of me that would never want to stop educating myself in some way, I love learning…. But there’s a part of me that feels like these feelings, failures and anxieties are going to kill me. I cant get help for it (no money) and my schools therapy services are booked up completely. 

I feel at a loss, I feel this void in my chest- I’m not sure what to do…. I’m almost looking for someone to tell me not to quit, but I know I won’t find that here on Reddit- people are typically pretty honest.
It sucks because in academia there’s literally NO ONE who cares an ounce for your well being so I’d have to just suck it up all over again- I’m not sure how long I can keep doing this, I feel like I’m drowning. ",2024-08-10 16:44:23,2,5,0,Negative,-0.003846153846153854,0,0,0
1eldn4c,careeradvice,Feedback not matching experiences at work. Am I insane?,"Hi everyone,
I guess I’m just looking for outside perspective on this situation. 

I started my job a few years ago. I seemed to get along well with my manager. People seemed friendly enough but didn’t really engage much with me even though I do feel like I put in the effort. I wrote it off as people not wanting to be too personal at work. Not a huge deal. 

It was a very small company and as I spent more time in the office (we’re all hybrid working), and as the company grew it became very obvious that it wasn’t a case of people not wanting to be personal and chatty at work because they would be this way with each other but it seemed like they were just leaving me out. 
When I am in the office, almost no one speaks to me despite me making effort. For instance, I will say good morning to people as I come in and no one will acknowledge me. 

There have been many times on a Friday where every single person sat around me has been personally invited to drinks after work but I have not been asked. 
I feel like I could go on and on because everyday there seems to be very small things that signal that I am not worth acknowledging. The way people that I sit in meetings with and produce work for will walk by me without even making eye contact etc. 

the manager I thought I got along quite well with in the beginning seems to have pushed me away. For instance, we went to see the same band play (different dates). I found this out from a colleague because he didn’t tell me. When I asked him how the show was he changed the subject abruptly. We actually have a fair bit in common (similar age) but he seems to do his best to not engage with me (but will with other team members). 

And to be clear, I am not looking to be best friends with these people. I am just looking for human treatment. I feel like I’m being outright rejected every day but I have no idea why and I do feel like it actively hurts my prospects in the company. 

As more people have joined my team my work was slowly taken off of me and replaced with what I would call ‘busy tasks’ - solely in charge of updating a clunky spreadsheet and then reporting on it, doing data entry- things that are very far from what I was hired to do. I brought this up with my manager countless times and he has said that my work is fine, I’m not being given these tasks it’s just the way it happens to have happened. 

It got to the point where I needed to sit down with him and provide him with two years worth of evidence to show him that he was indeed assigning only me these tasks while giving the other guys in my role the ‘actual’ work. 

Although I have never raised the issue of feeling like people don’t like me I have been quite direct with my manager about the quality of my work which he says is fine. 

The feedback that I get is that my work is very good and I am quick when I do it. I have gotten a few constructive points which I have aimed to address in the few instances where I have been given the actual relevant work but this goes un acknowledged unless I bring it up. 

I am always told how friendly and funny I am. I’m approachable and helpful. I’m really well liked. 

The feedback I get is so misaligned to my experiences that I feel like I am going crazy. 

I honestly can’t work out why they haven’t fired me (they are pretty ruthless in their firing so I have no doubt that if they didn’t want me there I wouldn’t be there). 

They are paying me a reasonable salary to basically do a data entry role (something that would be far cheaper to hire someone younger with no experience) and they don’t seem to like me personally (the company is actually very social). 

Fwiw I am actively looking for a new job elsewhere but I am honestly feeling like I’m imagining this. This has never happened in other companies I’ve worked for but it seems like such an odd situation that I can’t work out if it is just me or not. 

Thanks for reading sorry for the length. 

tldr: sad times for me because people seem to reject me socially at work and also I’ve been given entry level tasks instead of the job I’m paid to do. Feedback is almost glowing and doesn’t represent my experiences leaving me feeling like a crazy person. ",2024-08-06 09:48:59,14,26,0,Positive,0.053111703111703094,0,0,2

1dqjqe8,academia,"Does increasingly competitive academic landscape, delayed savings, and shift from DB to DC retirement plans put academics not on track for retirement?","Academia has become an increasingly more competitive career track, such that in order to be competitive for PhD admission, many people are completing postbac/predoc/lab manage/research tech jobs prior to PhD in addition to their Bachelors. Then they complete a PhD which can range from 5-7 years. Then to be competitive for a TT faculty role, many PhDs complete postdocs, sometimes for up to 4 years. In total, this can span a time as long as 10-15 years, maybe even more! This is substantially longer and more barriers to entry than many older faculty faced when they entered the job market. Additionally, when many older faculty entered the job market, pensions-- or Defined Benefit Plans-- were more common vehicles for retirement planning in academia in elsewhere. PhDs and postdocs generally do not offer retirement plans, AFAIK, and once an individual potentially lands a TT faculty role, the salary is within the $70-100k starting salary range on average

Over time, the Defined Contribution Plan-- or 401k in industry or 401a in academia-- has become the primary vehicle which people rely on to retire. The puts the onus on individuals to sufficiently contribute to their retirement plans both continually and sufficienty across time in order to retire, and also to contribute early. However, many academics will not be able to contribute to their retirement plans until their mid 30s, and statistics from Aon Consulting's 2008 Replacement Ratio Study ([see here](https://imgur.com/a/1Wb5A0J)) suggests that in order to maintain the same quality of living at same expenses, someone starting to save for retirement at age 35 will have to contribute in 6-11% range... That's even more for academics who begin receiving retire benefits later.

The experiment of Defined Contribution Plans being the primary vehicle through which people retire and prepare for retire has not really been borne out and early indications suggest that requiring people to use their own discretion to prepare for retirement may not be panning out. 83% of Americans may have to work into their 70s in order to afford to retire.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/magazine/401k-retirement-crisis.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/magazine/401k-retirement-crisis.html)

[https://medium.com/collapsenews/study-83-of-americans-will-have-to-work-into-their-70s-in-order-to-afford-to-retire-08eb7997225c](https://medium.com/collapsenews/study-83-of-americans-will-have-to-work-into-their-70s-in-order-to-afford-to-retire-08eb7997225c)

[https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings](https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings)

In other words, many Americans are not using DC plans to contribute enough to be prepared for retirement, many academics start contributing to retirement plans quite late and it is quite difficult to catch up, so they will need to contribute substantially more to be on track given the delayed savings.

My questions are:

* Given the current state of retirement planning in the U.S., will academics even be able to retire at retirement age due to fewer offerings of Defined Benefit Plans, a very long delay to begin savings, and only a modest starting salary?
* Does the academic career track need to be reformed in order to allow people to be on track to retirement comfortably at retirement age

My motivations for asking this is that I am personally of the opinion that the academic career track is among the most prolonged career tracks of any possible career (except perhaps medicine) with some of the most hidden costs (frequent moving with little to no financial support; no benefits until faculty) with insufficient payoff relative to the amount of training/prep (medicine has greater ultimate salary at end of the road), and that the consequences of the delayed savings from an academic career track in the current competitive landscape with postdocs, postbacs and prolonged PhDs has not been fully felt or realized.",2024-06-28 13:32:43,50,29,0,Positive,0.14573383084577113,0,0,2

Will I be setting myself up for failure if I try to come back weekly? I still plan on getting involved on campus and trying to make new friends but I just haven’t been able to get over this for the past few days, and want to hear advice from people in similar situations.

For some more context I’ve moved many times in the past and the last couple years I’ve spent in my hometown have been some of the best of my life in terms of my social life and enjoyment. I’ve often been isolated in the past after a move, and really don’t want that to happen again. ",2024-08-13 13:44:41,3,12,0,Positive,0.05240414347557205,0,0,2

I have few questions about your university / college attendance, if you don't mind, can you answer? first of all, I would love to know in which university or college you are studying into. :)

\[1.\] does your university/college have some sort of attendance criteria? like 75% (my university have this), if not achieved like they don't let take your final exams / end sems? anything related to that? any frustrations regarding this?

\[2.\] How does your teachers/professors take attendance? old-school pen and register (my university does this) or some online service (I would appreciate it a lot if you can name it.)

\[3.\] Do you get to know your total attendance (in percentage or whatever) on daily-basis or the university let you know it in intervals? like in my university they tell us about our total attendance just before exams and that's just not fair, because at that point, we can't even do anything about it. 

that's all. :)

1/ Apply for Umich/Cornell/NYU For winter (or spring) semester  
  
2/ Hold out and apply for Ivy league + Stanford + previous list 1 for 2025 fall semester  
  
Umich is nearly guaranteed because of a specific LoR I Have in addition to my credentials and the fact that I would be full pay, however since it’s a state school and I am an International Transfer Student from a 4 year, I probably wont get any aid.  
  
Financial situation: I am applying for aid for all universities where I can (except Umich and HYPD for obvious reasons), It’s not that I can’t pay, it’s that I obviously prefer not to and aid (even 20k out of 100k tuition) would be very helpful.  
  
Thing is I really want to do an accelerated masters and if I wait another year at my current Uni (T250) My chances of doing that will plummet, also I’m afraid I’ll do this wait and then ill only get into Umich, at which point ill ask myself why did I waste a year??  
  
I already completed 2 semesters at my current university, I’ll have to complete one more before a winter transfer, or 2 before fall semester (\*\*\*assuming I don’t take summer classes which I probably won’t)  
  
 I’ve been going over this for weeks now and I cant decide, is there any advice on what I should do? Is it really worth it holding out for that small chance of better name schools? I have my eyes on certain PhD programs (fully funded) so I am not sure what to do.  
  
Majors: Compsci & Stats. 4.0 GPA, INTNL and solid LoRs

1eq1hj7,careeradvice,J.D. instead of PhD? (Parent Issues),"Hi, I'm in my late 20s working in neuroscience research (U.S.). I planned to apply phd programs next year (to start classes in 2026). Have a great CV. However, I'm extremely down on that idea rn. 

I have a lot of student loans (and no savings). My salary is $\~80k which is high for academic research w/ no advanced degree. I lived off $17k for two years before this, which I think has deterred me from the PhD. I would get a $\~25-50k stipend, pending the program. Don't think I can commit to that income for 6 years. Also, the post-phd career path is basically impossible to forecast from the start of the program.

Considering law school b/c patent law seems to be a good intersection between law and science/research. I've been a paralegal (different field), have developed IP at startups (through research and applications). I've read relevant briefs, law textbooks, asked lawyers on reddit, etc. I've been reaching out to contacts IRL. I've spoken with law students going into patent litigation (**I am specifically interested in patent litigation**). Also currently studying for the LSAT.

However, I'm running into this ironic problem. My parents are both lawyers and every time this topic comes up they just shit on law and try making a case for me to stay in research. I think it's ironic because you usually hear about lawyer parents coercing their kids to go to law school, whereas I'm arguing with them until I'm blue in the face in favor of law school. 

Their case is essentially, I'm doing so well in research, why leave? They glorify research and are cynical about their own field. My dad said something like ""you're doing so great right now, in a year you could be the boss!"" and that's literally impossible. That's not how academia works. I need my phd, I need to do a postdoc, I need to move to fricken idaho or wherever will give me a tenure track position (which, is everything but impossible to get), and then maybe eventually I'll get my own lab. 

So I'm a little furious that my lawyer parents aren't fully endorsing my decision to pursue law school, particularly because while I can point out every way they are wrong about research they obviously know law. I'm never the type to need my parents' approval for anything (quite the opposite), however I'm finding myself stuck in the state of frustration that's making it hard for me to commit to applying to lawschool. I value the shit out of their opinions, they've been succesful lawyers for a very long time, it feels fundamentally wrong to go and become a lawyer when the lawyers who know me the most think I should do something else (they don't admit that this is what they're doing, but it is).

And lastly, my formal question would be, do you have any advice in general for trying to make a big switch like this? Do you think there are any career paths I'm overlooking? Any thoughts/opinions are welcome thank you.

1erev55,university,Bachelor Thesis - What counts as common knowledge?,"Hello hello,

I'm working on my bachelor's thesis right now and I've cited all of the main sources that I've consulted, but there are some things I've claimed that I feel are common knowledge and thus shouldn't need citation. I am however, not certain if this is the case.

My thesis is on character design for video game adaptations, and in my two case studies (League of Legends and Sonic) I spend a fair bit of time outlining the scope of the franchises in order to give context to the goals of each company with each adaptation. I list off quite a few of the games, series, music and films that each franchise has made, but I don't have sources for their existence, because it's surface level information that not even Wikipedia cites. I kind of feel like the existence of Sonic Frontiers would be common knowledge, and if not, I don't even know where to look to find a reference for that, beyond citing the games themselves (which would create a monstrously large bibliography).

Then there's another few things that I feel are just common sense but I might have to back up with sources, namely the purposes and goals of character design in general. I assert that the point of a character design is to function for the needs of the media it is in, that it communicates information about the character and ideally is appealing to the target audience of the media it appears in. I don't have a specific source for this, and I'm not sure if I can find one. All of the books and articles I've read seem to kinda just take these points for granted, but none of them say them outright.

If there's anyone here who's written a thesis before, could you give your two cents on whether or not these would count as common knowledge?",2024-08-13 18:09:45,1,2,0,Negative,-0.007393483709273183,0,0,0

Hello, everybody. I've fallen into a dilemma over my major and I need people's input, since my family couldn't care less.

I'm starting college soon, and I thought I was set on what I wanted and needed to do, which was marketing, but that changed last night. I was organizing myself and trying to learn different things that would put me ahead or make me stand out more. I was looking at YouTube videos, books, and online posts, and then I came across a post here on Reddit about how the marketing industry is not doing well at all. There's no demand, but a lot of supply, and it wasn’t guaranteed that I would get a job right out of college. After I saw that, I started looking more in-depth into it, and everything I found made it clear that if I want a good, stable income, I need to choose another career.

I've come from the worst of the worst, and that's a place I don’t want to fall back into, so I’m doing as much as possible to do things right. Thankfully, I've got 90% of my college tuition paid off, but the problem lies in my major. As much as I love marketing and digital creation, I’ve realized it might not be the right thing to do. I've started thinking about finance, and it’s something that interests me. The one thing holding me back is that I suck at math—like, really, really bad—and I’m guessing that major will involve a lot of math, or so it seems.

So this brings me to my point. Do I stick with marketing, work my ass off, and hope for the best, or do I change my major and trust myself to be able to pull through? Please give me all your advice I really need it.",2024-08-09 21:43:20,1,2,0,Positive,0.1207875457875458,0,0,2

I'm attending community college in the US. I'm waitlisted in spot #2 for a handful of classes. These professors are very positively scored by students on ratemyprofessors.

I'm very aware that ratemyprofessors is not an all-encompassing, definitive site for what you might experience in a professor's class, but at my school it has generally been pretty fair and spot on to what each prof/their class is like.

Am I close enough on the waitlists at #2 to not worry about if I'm getting in? Is it silly to stay on the waitlist instead of registering for the other profs' classes?

""PDR posts at [] provide the opportunity for recent PhD graduates to develop further research experience, in collaboration with and mentored by more senior colleagues. This is seen as a transitional position between a PhD and a longer-term research career. Duties and responsibilities of the role are meant to both address the needs of the project and support the successful candidate's professional and intellectual development as a researcher. The line managers will support the Post-doctoral Researcher to achieve a programme of published work and to identify and pursue suitable future funding opportunities, building up independent fundraising skills. The income target is currently 192 days. The Post-Doctoral Researcher will be a member of a home cluster whose leader and members can be expected to provide broader intellectual support, but who are not responsible for fundraising or career progression. 

The PDR position is a fixed-term position, fully funded in Year 1, 75% in Year 2, and 50% in Year 3, as individuals will be expected to pursue funding opportunities to diversify their funding in years 2 and 3. If funding is not secured at the expected level, several supportive steps will be followed, as set out in the PDR policy. With support and training, the aim is for the PDR to develop their own portfolio of work. It is anticipated that for the right candidate this role will eventually lead to the possibility of application to a Fellowship position at IDS, subject to a vacancy arising and meeting the required standards as assessed by the Fellow Review and Promotion Board (FRPB). Post-Doctoral Researchers will have a ‘Career Progression Review’ towards the end of their two years in post, conducted by a designated small group of IDS research leaders and managers, to take stock of performance and advise on career development prospects. All PDRs are additionally welcome to take advantage of the Institute’s mentoring scheme"".


What are others' opinions on this? It's the first time I've seen a contractual arrangement like this advertised for a post-doc in the UK. Is this becoming more common?

I know it's very normal for post-docs to be on short-term contracts and to need to apply for grants, fellowships etc. to increase chances of getting another contract when their current contract expires.
But I've never seen a fixed-term PDR contract where having to apply for grants to fund the salary of the advertised contract is written into the contract.

I mean, job stability is bad enough for post-docs already... Imagine showing a contract like this to your mortgage company or even to a letting agent - they would turn you down in an instant. Not sure how they expect anyone to work on such terms.

1duwguk,stress,"I failed my only incomplete class by 1% and will not be getting my Bachelor’s, is there really no resolution?","It’s all my fault of course, I have no one to blame but myself. I have been so horribly depressed since the end of last year when my boyfriend left me, I feel like I’ve lost the little motivation I had to care anymore. I’ve grown very pessimistic towards my future, my surroundings, most days now I wish I was dead or would xxxx myself. I’m barely making it by and I feel like I am nothing but a nuisance to my parents household, I can’t communicate, I don’t feel comfortable sharing my issues, nothing helps. My parents are so disappointed and hurt by me, my mom expressed that she feels uncomfortable in her own home because of me and my dad the other day confronted me about his concerns over myself and dropped bombshell news that he’s had cancer for the last 8 years (manageable/not lethal) but he’s kept it hidden from me so that I can focus on school. I finished my recent and what was supposed to be my last semester with an incomplete in one class, I just couldn’t find the energy or desire to write two papers throughout the semester and was extended to work on it for a couple more months. I still got to walk at my graduation, my extended family knows I “graduated” and my parents expected me to finish despite this setback, and even with all this time I still failed because I put it off until the last minute and submitted subpar and incomplete work, something my dad only recently expressed his disappointment in me for. I did finish one paper but apparently I didn’t even understand the assignment correctly so I got a C, the other I ran out of time to complete so I got a plain F. With the other few Bs that I had in my class I finished with a D+ for a major course that requires at minimum a C. 

My God, I feel like I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to do this anymore, the only reason I’m still here is because I’m a coward and I can’t do that to my parents, they would never forgive themselves for the rest of their lives for something that’s not their fault. But now I’m faced with the reality that despite assuring my parents that I would get things resolved, I failed. This has been the worst semester of my life. I wasted my parents time and my teachers time. I hate life more and more by the day and this is just the cherry on top. Is there really nothing that I can do?

I’ve already spoken to my advisor and said instructor for the course, my advisor could only tell me basically it is what it is and I’ll have to retake it again in the fall, I will not be getting my degree. My instructor is surely well over my poor performance this semester, I felt like I was nothing but a nuisance in his class and for all the extra time and support that I’ve had to beg him for, I absolutely do not blame him, I can only point to myself for my own shortcomings.

But to be just 1% away, I didn’t want a good grade at this point, I knew very well that that wasn’t happening, but omg, I just needed to pass. I can’t mentally/emotionally take this, I have let my family down yet again and will likely worsen a relationship that’s already falling apart, I feel absolutely sick, alone, I just want to give up. I have no money because I overspend, still no job, I feel abandoned by who I thought was the love of my life, and I want to xxxx myself every day. I’m in many different kinds of therapy, but for what?? Nothing helps, it all feels pointless and like a waste of time but I do it to make my parents happier I guess, and give me SOMETHING to do.

Please, I just need to know is this really it, I can’t do anything further to boost my grade to just the tip of a C letter grade? I’ve reached out to the Dean of academics as well in hopes MAYBE they’ll have something to offer, but I’m not hopeful.

I can’t take another semester of this bullshit, I don’t want to have to face my parents and tell them that after everything, their time, money, and trust in me was wasted. What do I do, please, I am so so desperate.

TL;DR I failed an incomplete class and will not be receiving my bachelors, it seems hopeless. My mental health has been at its worst and I fear disappointing my parents. Is there nothing I can do to just get by with a C instead of D letter grade?",2024-07-04 02:55:03,0,2,0,Negative,-0.07754773406947321,0,0,0

1e9zy6r,students,"Collection Of 8 Study Techniques I’ve Started To Use As A Student
","Here are some techniques I’ve started to implement from online sources like tiktok and other sources. Some of these may be slightly personal lol. 

1. Atomic habits. Start dedicating a small portion of your day for just studying. This can be as little as 15 mins in the evening. The first few days are difficult, but once you get into the cycle, the habit will be hard to break. You can also slowly increase your duration. 
2. Here's a 3 step process for understanding concepts: 1. During classes I take notes from exactly what my professor is saying, without worrying too much about the design of the page. 2. I read about that subject and try to organize the page, adding definitions, examples, colors, titles, links... 3. Read the page when the tests are coming.
3. Do the Pomodoro technique PROPERLY. It works
4. ORGANIZE. Combine your notes in one section, study guides altogether in the front, and sort out unneeded classwork. Color code different class materials and don't use the same binder/notebook for two (or more) different classes.
5. Teach kids in simple concepts, terms and analogies... you can be confident in your mastery of the subject. Recall is best when the study environment matches the Recall environment. Best Recall cues are scents. Chew a particularly strong mint gum while encoding the info...do the same during testing. Associative memory is also easier to recall, so create links to the encoded information that relate to subjects super familiar to you.
6. Ask ChatGPT to summarize all the important notes and ideas to make them easier to remember. 
7. Review your notes within twenty-four hours. This can save you hours of extra studying in the long run. Make sure it's within 24 hours though! Science isn't 100% sure why it has to be done within that time frame, but it could be because of (theoretical but certainly not debunked) ""neural dumping."" Basically, this means as you sleep at night your brain shits out all the information that is non-essential. Guess what's non-essential: calculus. history. English lit. Sure, not to you, but to your brain? It says, ""F\*\*k it, we need the space. Get rid of this crap.""
8. Spaced repetition has been shown to improve retention of information. Study in short, frequent sessions with lots of review. Don't study for a long time the day before the test. Try to have multiple study sessions each day a couple weeks before the exam. Maybe 15 minutes at the most, 3-4 times a day. Break up what you need to study in sections.
9. If worst comes to worst, offer to f\*\*k your teacher.

1eiat9t,academia,Etiquette About Applying to New PhD Programs due to PI Misfit ,"Hello all,

I have found myself in an unfortunate situation. Last year I had applied to bio-engineering PhD programs and was lucky enough to be accepted to a program with ample funding from a professor. However, after meeting the professor in person and talking to current students I started to form a pit in my stomach. Most of them were miserable and warned me against joining (even though I had already accepted as the professor only gave me a week to decide after they extended an offer. Apparently that's not normal protocol according to some current PhD friends).

I ended up having a chat with the department head at a later time and was told that my soon-to-be PI has had a history of students leaving or dropping out (since other professors in the department don't have much funding). I was even advised that I should consider starting over at another university from the department head and another professor whose work I was interested in. As one can imagine, I am deeply sad that I would have to go through the whole application process again (RIP my meager savings).

My main concern would be how should I go about mentioning this during my re-applications. Should I keep it short and simple (i.e. one sentence) in my statement of purpose, or include an additional small write-up to explain the situation? Should my one of my LoR's address this too or just me?

I'm quite nervous now since I had always dreamed of doing a PhD since I'm in love with academic research. I'm so (maybe irrationally so) scared that this situation will ruin my chances of becoming a professor in the future.

Thank you for reading the ramblings of a post-undergrad who doesn't know what she's doing and could use some help :')

EDIT for more info: I have already discussed the possibility of co-advising, but no faculty in the department wants to work with my soon-to-be PI and my soon-to-be PI was not too receptive about the idea. A lot of people around me are telling me to start over sooner than later right now.",2024-08-02 14:01:09,22,16,0,Positive,0.01809327036599764,0,0,2

1cyoa8y,university,Should I take a gap year,"Hello, so I just finished a Bachelor in international politics at the University of London Institute in Paris and I applied to a bunch of universities for a masters. I was highly successful in my applications, getting into international relations/security masters from institutions like LSE, CEU, UCL, Luiss, KCL, and more. However, I was not accepted to Sciences Po, which was the only 2 year course.

The main issue I have is that, as I only just turned 20, and the degree that I would be choosing (LSE), is only a 1 year course, I feel like I am being rushed into the career life, and my student life will have been too short. I am really interested in what I study and would aspire to work in diplomacy, but I feel like I’m not ready to finish my university in only 1 year. I did my first year online due to covid so I have only done 2 years of proper university. Overall I feel like my education, starting from high school which I finished at 17 in italy (2 years before the norm in Italy), has been rushed. 

Although I am very interested in what I study, I also have other passions and interests which I have had to give up during the final stretch of my undergraduate degree. I feel like I have had to suppress all of those passions, including my music project which I have worked really hard at. I kind of feel like part of me is being lost and it makes me quite sad. British universities also do not allow deferrals, and there is no guarantee I get the same acceptances next year.

I know LSE can be a vital platform to get really far and it is up there as the best university for those, like myself, who aim to become diplomats, but I feel like I am short on time before entering the suppressive environment that is the professional career ratchase.

Any advice would be well appreciated! ❤️",2024-05-23 08:58:52,1,8,0,Positive,0.10029411764705883,0,0,2

1dh99xz,academia,To adjunct or not to adjunct? ,"I finished my PhD in Art History in the US (yeah, I know, go ahead and laugh) in May and am now on the job market. I've been applying for teaching and museum jobs as well as postdocs since October without success, including getting rejected from two amazing positions at my own institution that I felt confident about when I applied. I've even applied for some industry jobs and had no success there either. Everything I've heard from faculty advisors and other recent grads about the job market has been doom and gloom, and even though I've got enough savings to stay out of any real financial trouble for several more months, I'm starting to panic.

I finally got my first and only job offer which has not made me panic less. 

It is essentially a part-time adjunct teaching position at a respected institution in New York City, which is one of a handful of cities I could feasibly relocate to along with my fiancé who works in the film postproduction industry. It pays almost nothing, and I applied for it when I was feeling especially desperate. I would have to move to NYC in a matter of months if I accepted it, not to mention scramble to find a supplementary source of income to afford life in NYC and ideally a better full-time position as soon as possible. But on the other hand, teaching *is* what I am most passionate about and having a career in academia would be my dream; and with the job market as bad as it is, I fear that if I turn this opportunity down when I have no other solid prospects in sight, I could be left jobless for many more months or even years. Perhaps it would be better to have *some* teaching on my CV for future applications at this time than none at all? Perhaps any job is better than nothing?

I told myself that I wouldn't get trapped in ""adjunct hell"" and that I would be able to find more stable and fulfilling full-time work in my field after graduating, but now I'm beginning to worry that this is the absolute best I'm going to get, at least so soon after the PhD, and that the alternative might have to be switching careers entirely/getting a ""survival job"" of some sort that pays the bills while I look for something that makes use of my degree. 

Please let me know your thoughts on adjuncting and especially whether taking part-time teaching jobs is worth it when no other better options are on the table. Did you ever take such jobs and manage to move on to bigger and better things? How did you stay afloat while teaching part-time? Would you rather be unemployed or change careers/take work unrelated to your field of study than adjunct? Do you think it is ever a good idea to adjunct or not? If you chose not to adjunct and got ""survival jobs"" instead, how did you manage to find such jobs that would take you on despite being overqualified?

And yes, feel free to laugh at the naïve art historian who got a PhD but can't find good work. Trust me I agree with you and deeply regret what I've done with my life! Thank you!",2024-06-16 14:53:22,30,36,0,Positive,0.15097908913698388,0,0,2
1eppwz7,careeradvice,Any other actors transition into sales? Worth it?,"
I’ll spare you the hundred reasons why I’m over the grind of my acting career, but I’m looking to transition Into a career that is more stable. Also I’m tired of being a bartender and my wife and I want kids soon. 

Would this transition make sense for me? Has anyone else done this? The hard thing, is that I’m 35 and I haven’t built up a resume for sales (or anything) other than a decade of restaurant experience with a small window of some tech experience at a startup. And I honestly don’t know if I can take some of the entry level sales jobs with low base pay I see out there. Some of the lower end sales jobs seem AWFUL honestly. 

Obviously I’m a performer, good at communicating and good with people and public speaking but there’s no way for people trust my ability if they don’t give me a chance. If anyone has any idea or advice on how to go about this possible transition in the best way, I’d love to hear it. ",2024-08-11 17:09:31,1,0,0,Positive,0.06885964912280701,0,0,2

1cwp6w1,university,I survived being shot in the head but have disabilities. What has been your experience with getting accommodations at university and having them implemented/respected?,"I am graduating from community college soon, and having accommodations implemented/respected by professors has not always been easy. I am completely blind in one eye and have poor vision in the other. I have learning disabilities related to slow processing speed. In addition to ADHD, I have been diagnosed with dyscalculia(Dyslexia but with Math)  and dysgraphia(piss poor handwriting), but altogether, not doing too bad for someone who took a .380 pistol to the head. 

Here is a copy of the current disability letter with the identifying information removed

Judas has a disability that results in a substantial limitation to a major life function. Due to the nature of the disability, this letter serves as verification of a disability and the right to reasonable accommodations as designated below throughout the student's academic study.
Counseling & Accessibility Services has determined the following accommodation(s) to be reasonable and appropriate for Judas.

»
»
Calculator: The student has been approved to use of a four-function (add, subtract, multiply, divide) calculator for exams and assignments unless the purpose of the exam is to assess the student's mathematical computation skills that can only be measured without the use of the calculator.

Distraction-Reduced Environment: The student is approved to test in an environment where distractions are minimized. This does not guarantee a private or “distraction-free” room but rather a space with fewer distractions. Instructors can provide a DRE, such as another classroom or the instructor's private office. If testing in the testing center, the student must schedule their exam at least three business days in advance.

 Enlarged Print: The student may need to have a larger font or test on larger paper. Please check with the student about their preferred font size.

 Extended Time: The student requires time and a half on all timed in-person and online/remote class assignments, quizzes, and examinations. This time extension must be in addition to the time the class is receiving. 
Extended Timed exams in the Testing Center must be scheduled three business days in advance. Instructors are responsible for adding extended time to any timed online quiz/exam/assignment. This accommodation does not include extending due dates for assignments.

 Note Taker: Taking handwritten notes in class presents some barriers. Instructors should assist the student in finding a note-taker by making an announcement in class or providing a copy of the instructor's notes for in–person and synchronous instructor-led online courses.
 Scribe: The student requires someone to write for them. When recording answers to an exam item, the scribe will respond in writing or by typing the answers exactly how it is dictated to them by the student and abstain from using his/her own judgments.


 Type Assignments: The student requires the use of a computer for handwritten assignments. The assignments can be submitted in print form or via electronic mail, depending on the preferences of the instructor

1er9g3k,careeradvice,From academia to... what next? ,"I always dreamed of becoming a teacher / working in academia. I got my bachelor's in Childhood and Special Ed and then my masters in Teaching English to Students of Other Languages - graduated 2022. After only a year of teaching, I realized it was not sustainable in terms of the pay ($55,000 a year and awful benefits) and the time and energy commitment. Now I'm working in higher ed administration ($65,000 a year) and while I'm much happier in this role, I also realize that my goal is to eventually make a 6 figure salary (living in NYC, this is a must to be able to afford a decent lifestyle, especially since my partner is unwilling to move). 
Because I'm working in higher ed, I could potentially get another degree for free through tuition remission, but I don't even know what field I should consider. My background is completely in academia, I have never been a tech/finance person, but more and more I wonder if I need to set aside my interests and pre-existing skills/degree and essentially restart with marketing myself towards a field that makes good money. I also worry that it may be too late because even if I try to change path now, it will be evident through my resume that my background is completely in academia and it may be hard to even get an interview.

1csx54n,academia,I had a manuscript rejected by a well-known journal for low scientific rigor ,"Hi, 

Recently, a manuscript from a chapter of my doctoral thesis was rejected by a journal.

The journal's argument was: ""The content of this manuscript does not meet the standards of quality or scientific rigor required by the journal to be considered for peer review.""

My advisor suggested that the rejection was due to the manuscript not aligning with the journal's scope. However, I am concerned because understanding textually the message of the journal, it may be that my paper idea is not publishable because the scientific rigor is low. I asked the editor the specific reasons for this low scientific rigor detected and I have no answer. It is suspicious because I recently learned that this journal is considered a ""predatory"", even though it is known to have a reputation. 

I intend to submit the manuscript to another journal, but I am frustrated by the minimal explanation provided by these journals regarding their decisions.

I agree that the [layout](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/network/publishing/societies/open-access/continuous-improvement-in-publishing-spotlight-on-new-journal-design) is clear, though in my opinion it only really works well for social sciences and sciences. It does not work well for humanities journals, especially those that extensively rely on visual material in disciplines such as cultural studies and art history.

Depending on the journal, NJD for humanities seems a little bit like a rudimentary paper written in Word and loses the kind of visual clarity of humanities journals published by other publishers (*American Art* from Chicago or *Culture, Theory and Critique* from Taylor & Francis)

Here is a comparison from *Curator: The Museum Journal* of a [pre-NJD article](https://doi.org/10.1111/cura.12532) and a [post-NJD article](https://doi.org/10.1111/cura.12578). Both are open access. The journal is interdisciplinary, at the nexus of social sciences and humanities, but the change is very recent.

so im currently pursuing a bsc in data science (2 nd year )at a mediocore/bad college with no placement  in my own city, i have plans about preparing for mba but now im reconsidering my descisions of continuing here as there no placement , internships by the time i get my degree i wont have anything to write in my resume or a real life skill required for job market as for mba ill not have work ex and will have to go in as fresher and also there is no college life

i have seen few ug courses in enteprenuership where we can pursue degree(bba) in another (will have collge life) and are also  taught real life skills where by the time i graduate ill have 3-4 intenships exp and also there is placement guarentee here the drawback are that ill have to leave my current course to join which means 1 year gap also leaving in another city cost and course cost goes upto 10-12 lakhs. here maybe i could work for 1-2 yrs get the work ex and go for mba but i dont that i can study after working as many ppl  say its difficult for them to study for something after joining jobs as they are over it .

so i have 2 options

1 ) continue with my current college do some side skills  online , try to get online internship to make my resume look good and start preparing for cat in 2nd year itself and try for cat 2025 and cat 2026 .

2) leave my current course join the course mentioned above related to entrepreunuership work for some time or as fresher go for mba

is it worth spending so much for ug now as im already going to spend around 15-20 lakhs for mba also not to be negative but im also not the smartest , am a bit shy and nervous and introverted thats what contemplating me to go to another city to get that social skill and getting over my fear ,also education!! haha.",2024-08-05 17:27:10,1,0,0,Positive,0.015416666666666657,0,0,2

1dqos8g,academia,What I think is my best work just got rejected viciously,"TL;DR I will get over it, but I'm feeling so dejected and need a little sulk.

I spent last year writing an article that I thought was the best work that I had ever done. It wasn't going to change the field, but it would have questioned how we read a very important text and solved some contentious issues. And my mentors and friends, some of whom are leading experts on this author, agreed it would be an important addition to the literature on this work. I knew it would be somewhat controversial because it challenges prevailing methodologies, but I didn't expect to find it difficult to publish. (It's not controversial in that it's political or anything - it's just against the dominant approach, so it's not that I'm a conspiracy theorist or anything like that.) 

Well, after 9 months, 5 months after I asked the editors what was going on, they got back to me with two readers' reports that were quite possibly the most vicious bits of feedback I have ever read. One of them even wrote, ""this type of thing might be fine in a graduate seminar, but it has no business being published"". I haven't been a grad student for some time now, so this pointed comment really hurts. Only about a tenth of their reports were substantive points, some of which I can see where they're coming from, others I can see just being a matter of opinion or a misconstrual of my point, but the bulk of these reports were baseless and rather unhelpful attacks. I'm fine with reviewers disagreeing with me, but what's up with the vitriol? I'm fine with the rejection itself (there are always other journals), but I just feel so hurt by some of the comments and the tone/condescension. Is this what my colleagues at large think of me or my work in general? Am I actually crazy for thinking that my piece was good? I could never imagine anyone saying some of the stuff in these reports to anyone's face (a colleague or student) - some of their comments makes me want to shrivel up and die - so how can I ever face any colleague again? (Of course, I don't know who the reviewers were, which is both a blessing and a curse.) 

I just want to crawl into bed and cry for the rest of the day... I know I'm a bit dramatic, but I'm just so sad and so deflated now... I think I might have to just eat my feelings this evening

I know I would be the weakest developer in the company/feel like imposter and difficult probably as I have found maths is needed for every software developer problem in the past for the kinds of jobs I want to pursue. I started taking maths courses online for calculus, trigonometry, algebra, etc. but the courses are taking a really long time to get through. Is it a good idea to finish the courses first or to apply for a graduate position? Would they help me to learn the maths or expect me to already know it? If I was given other tasks I fear I would never learn the maths that is baseline.

1es54k7,college,Switch Majors from Ecology to Engineering?,"Hello, I am about to start my second year of college, and I am having reservations about my major (ecology). While I really like ecology as a field, the financial instability and lack of jobs in ecology are making me reconsider it as a career. I did an ecology research internship this summer, and I did not love the work as much as I thought that I would. The reason that I would like to switch majors is the aforementioned better careers, but I also enjoy STEM (Calc II was probably my favorite class last year). Also, I feel that I could still do environmental/environmental adjacent work with an engineering degree. The fields that I would to switch to are electrical engineering (mainly so I could work with renewable energy and that sort of thing) and civil engineering (mainly so I could green infrastructure and public transport). The only thing keeping me from switching majors atp is that I have already done a few internships with ecology so my resume is already decent and I love ecology and only like engineering (if that makes sense). Any advice on this problem, or if anyone has any advice about switching to engineering from a non-engineering major, would be appreciated!

I was hoping to get some insight on it's worth taking my master's degree here in the Philippines (does it make my chances of landing a job in a firm better) or should I just work my way up (since Bachelors or Masters is not really compared much in your area)?

1e4qf3b,academia,Looking for unconventional ideas for improving research assessment! A 1-question survey!,"Hi everyone,

So I work at a research funder in Europe, and a CoARA ([www.coara.eu](http://www.coara.eu/)) working group I'm participating in is looking into research assessment and how it could be changed to improve research culture.

We've created a anonymous 1-question survey to collect ideas for potential experiments in research assessment - new ways to measure and recognize good research and researchers. You can fill it out here: [https://uhasselt.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_aWcPDmJVDOjdLN4](https://uhasselt.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aWcPDmJVDOjdLN4)

The idea is to get as many ideas as possible, from as many people as possible. We will then publish a catalog of ideas with the results, and work on developing a few high-potential ones into pilots.

Could you please:

* Fill out the survey with your ideas (you can fill it out more than once).
* Share it with everyone you know from academia and beyond
* Anything else that would help us shift research assessment and improve research culture

You can contact the co-chair of the working group if you have questions: [sean.sapcariu@fnr.lu](mailto:sean.sapcariu@fnr.lu)

    I did my PhD in Physics from a  university in France in 2021. I'm currently working as a postdoc.  It's been 3 years since I completed my PhD and some of the publication are still not published. They are still stuck in the review phase apparently. As I'm looking for jobs currently, I keep getting question why these papers are still in arxiv and not being published.

My former supervisor was the corresponding author for the publication and he is the one who is getting the feedback from the journals. I kept asking him about the progress through mails, but hey is not responding to my mails since a year. As a result of this, two of my manuscripts are still in Arxiv without getting published. 

How can I deal with a supervisor? 
I'm thinking of sending him another mail, this time with former head of department and head of school as CC. But he is an egoistic person and I'm afraid doing this might further offend him. This is bad for me because a lot of postdocs ask reference letter from former PhD guide.

However, some would argue that it's time-consuming since often it would go for a semester before one can be admitted for a thesis/dissertation after having a ""passed"" rating from IP.

1bmhicx,stress,Message in a bottle for the universe,"So lately I’ve been in my head a lot, and I know how bad that can be sometimes. I just turned 23 years old in February so I guess you can say I’m moving more into my mid 20’s. Life has been kicking my ass lately and it’s my fault. I had this girlfriend named T and I met her when I was 21, we were supposed to have a kid but she said it was a miscarriage or she didn’t know she was pregnant. At that moment that’s where I pinpointed where everything went downhill for me(ground zero if you will). Little by little I started to see feelings change, more arguing over me wanting to always see her because at this point in my life I don’t have anyone but her.

She ended up leaving me for  her best friend. 
I stayed up countless nights crying wondering why wasn’t I good enough. I honestly just wanted to die.. 
why you may ask? Well I didn’t finish my high school diploma, I would get kicked out for fighting because people would try to bully me, I had good grades always but my mom moved us around so much I couldn’t finish on time.
 I didn’t have a car, but I had 2  jobs. One of those jobs was with T and around Christmas through early January I wasn’t getting scheduled so I didn’t have money to get her Christmas presents or birthday present but I did paint a beautiful canvas with a tree that symbolized our love. I thought it would be enough but it wasn’t :(, fast forward 2 years later I’m working at Macys and I get fired. At this point I’m just being truthful, I live with my mom but I always paid my half of rent yknow. 
T ends up coming back into my life cause her best friend cheated on her twice I think, but this girl is my padmae (soulmate) so I forgave her and welcomed her back. Through the time we’ve been separated those had to be my worst two years ever, seriously I was depressed, looking for work unsuccessfully, I couldn’t even move on because of everything me and her went through especially losing a kid. In a way it made her my only family. 
Now up to date she wanted to take things slow but it’s problems because I want to see her for longer than what she sees me which is 2 mins before she goes to work but goes out with her guy friends. I’m not controlling you know but I feel like my feelings aren’t being respected. So I told her about it and she said I’m not her man and that we’re just talking but everyday we’re lovey dovey saying how much we mean to each other.  I just know when people start to lose feelings or maybe I’m just paranoid because of when she left me the first time for someone else..
I ended up getting blocked and ignored for 2 days and I just apologized cause I don’t want to lose her, I can’t. She has all type of guy followers with half a mil 300k followers and it just honestly hurts my heart so much cause she’s been replying dry lately and there was some things she said that just let me know that I can be replaced by any guy that follows her. :( 

I know everyone has their own path in life but I can’t even get hired by a job currently. I enrolled in adult school to get my hs diploma im almost done with it, but my moms been belittling me and her bf from prison keeps manipulating her to kick me out. Life seems like I finally hit rock bottom and im scared cause im Lost. Sometimes I wish my father was alive to have guidance maybe my life would’ve turned out better than the decisions I’ve made to get me to this point. Depressed now more than ever cause my life is passing by just like that and the love of my life.. she might be losing feelings for me and it makes me so so sad because I want to be able to buy her nice things and go on trips with her and start a family with her but I can’t get hired and I’m struggling on my geometry class on acellus. I always try to keep the Kobe mentality but it’s hard when you have no one. 
It’s 3:09 currently in Los Angeles, I just had to get this out or else I can feel myself self destruct. 
Being lost at 23 sucks man.

I’m sorry I tried I did and I failed

1dnv2hg,academia,I am so done with grad school(masters) and I am thinking of graduating with a non-thesis route.,"Hello fellow grad students,

How is your summer going? I need to vent and ask for some advice. I've been working on my master's thesis for the past two months. After countless meetings with my professor and many advising sessions, I've come to a tough realization: I can't write for shit. My work is disorganized, my thoughts are jumbled, and my research has gaps. I'm feeling really confused right now. 

My thesis defense is in two weeks, and I'm not at all confident about it. My work feels like a mishmash of contributions from my PI and two other researchers who aren't even part of my university. Reflecting on my work, I realize I've done most things because my professor told me to, not because I had a clear direction.

I have a good job lined up after graduation, but I also have significant student debt. I have enough credits to graduate as a non-thesis student if I fail my defense. Should I go ahead and graduate without the thesis, or should I stick it out and finish my thesis? I've paid tuition out of pocket for two out of four semesters (plus summer), and my advisor did support me with hourly pay.

1en93rb,careeradvice,Advice: Balancing Potential Offers,"Hello! I have been searching for a job and have been unemployed for 4 months (nothing wrong with my last job, I just moved states), but I am quickly anticipating both an end to my unemployment, and a conundrum. I am interviewing with 3 companies:

Company A:

* Kinda my top choice. The role is different from my previous experiences, but the company opened this role *specifically* because they heard what I said in prior interviews for a different role, and determined that those skills are more needed at the moment. The hiring manager even said ***""I want you on my team""*** and has been updating me on the process before the recruiter even knows, so I am near guaranteed to get the role.
* Commute is kinda far (45\~60min), but role can be hybrid, and job includes up to 25% travel.
* Big company, great benefits, big growth opportunity.
* **Their process has taken time, and I have yet to officially start interviewing for the new role...**
* An offer may not come for several weeks

Company B:

* A really good fit - very similar to the roles I have done in the past.
* Short commute most days (10\~15 min)
* Interview process was only 2 weeks start-to-finish, concluding in a skills test
* Good benefits, medium-sized company, medium growth opportunity
* **Anticipating an offer by next week**

Company C:

* A really good fit - very similar to the roles I have done in the past.
* Commute is kinda far (\~45min), but after 6 months the role can be hybrid up to 2 days a week
* Interviews took only a week: first a short phone call, and today is 90 minutes onsite
* Good benefits, big company, medium growth opportunity
* If onsite goes well, **offer would come in by tomorrow**

Assuming salary and other benefits are comparable, what are my options?

1. Do I turn down B & C and wait for A?
2. Could I accept an offer from B or C now, and then quit when A gives an offer?
3. Do I turn down A because they took too long?

Thanks in advance!

1enbmg6,university,International Transfer Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m an undergraduate student from East China Normal University (ECNU) in China. I initially enrolled in the Software Engineering program in the fall of 2022 but switched to the Geography Honors program in the fall of 2023. I’m expected to graduate in 2027. In the spring semester of 2024, I also decided to pursue a minor in Japanese at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, so I’m currently working on both majors.

However, due to personal reasons and various external factors, I’m finding it difficult to continue my studies at ECNU. So, I’m considering applying to other universities this application season.

Here are my current credentials: I scored 683 out of 750 on the Chinese Gaokao (with individual scores in Chinese: 116, Math: 137, English: 136, Physics: 100, Chemistry: 97, Geography: 97), my current GPA is 3.1 with an average score of 81.11, and I have an IELTS score of 6.5 overall (Listening: 6.0, Reading: 6.5, Writing: 7.0, Speaking: 6.5).

I’m considering applying to the following schools: National University of Singapore (NUS), University of Edinburgh, University of Manchester, Durham University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of Georgia, University of Texas at Austin, and Lund University. I hope to continue studying Geography, with plans to apply for a Master’s or a direct Ph.D. program, ideally focusing on remote sensing research.

I actually applied to NUS during the 2022-2023 application season, but unfortunately, I didn’t meet their minimum IELTS requirement at the time, so I wasn’t accepted. This year, I’ve improved my score to meet their criteria, so I’m thinking of trying again, though I’m not overly confident about my chances.

Next, I’m considering three UK schools: Edinburgh, Manchester, and Durham, in that order of preference. I have a few questions regarding UK universities: Is it possible to transfer the credits I’ve earned at my Chinese university? If so, will my GPA also transfer? Additionally, I’m concerned about the cost of tuition for undergraduate programs in the UK, so I’m hoping to find a shorter program duration to help offset the expenses.

As for the three U.S. schools, I visited the University of Texas at Austin for an academic exchange program in January-February 2024. I was really impressed by the school and enjoyed the Geography courses I attended. As for the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Georgia, I haven’t visited them and don’t know much about them. I’m considering U.S. schools partly because of the country’s strong global standing. Despite some challenges, it remains a major power and might offer a more stable environment, with possibly less discrimination. However, the high cost of living in the U.S. is a concern, so I’ve chosen a few schools in less urban areas in the hopes of reducing living expenses.

Lastly, there’s Lund University. I learned about Lund while researching global rankings for Geography programs. It’s a strong school for Geography in Sweden, but since it’s a Nordic university, I’m not very familiar with it. I’d appreciate any insights or advice on this.

Thanks for reading! If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Also, if you have any other university recommendations, please share! I’m really looking for more good options right now!!",2024-08-08 17:15:35,1,1,0,Positive,0.084853234563056,0,0,2

1dp1q2g,academia,How to make a disciplinary pivot,"Hi all. I'm a US-based PhD candidate on the job market this year. My field is on the humanities/social science border. Just providing some context before getting into the ask.

All three of my degrees are in this field (for funding purposes, leaving wasn't an option). Since I started my grad work, I've been told by faculty and reviewers that my work is ""too interdisciplinary"" for the field and other variations of not being in-discipline enough. Between that, limited freedom in what postdocs/assistant profs can teach, and big disciplinary drama, I've been ready to leave the field for a while. The field(s) in which I'm interested in jobs are all adjacent to my current discipline, so it's not like I want to go from Philosophy to Biochem or something lol.

Now that I'm on the market, I finally want to make the pivot, but I'm struggling with the ""how."" Because my CV is very oriented to my current discipline, I worry that on paper I look like a bad fit. I know that if I get a job talk/interview, I can sell myself; I'm concerned I won't even get to that point.

I know every field/department has issues. I know that the tenure track sucks regardless of your research/pedagogical areas. I'm just not invested enough in the work/trajectory of my current discipline to stay past the 11 years I've already invested in it.

1elr2ul,careeradvice,I told my boss that I was in this job for the long haul…then I found a job I want to apply to a whole week later.,"I’ve been working at my organization for 5 years now and I get paid okay. It has some pretty sweet benefits. But there are some major problems. 

A couple years ago, I was asked if I wanted to fill in as a scrum master at my place of work to make up for a scrum master that had moved into the role of project manager. I said yes because it sounded like an awesome growth opportunity. The caveat was that I’d be scrum master part time and filling my same job that I’d had for a few years at that point. 

It started out busy, which I expected, but I’m still performing my old role at full-time capacity. I am completing more work than some coworkers in the same position without the scrum master role. I told my boss in 2023 that I think I had done an amazing job and deserved a promotion because my salary is only based off my original title…which does not make as much money as a scrum master. And two years in a row now, my raise has been the same or less than my colleague that only has to do his singular role. He also started this job a couple years after me and our salaries are quite similar. 

On top of that, I am compensating for other colleagues. We work in tech and my boss hired a person he seems to really identify with. Only this person is so bad at their job sometimes. I tried telling my boss this and he wouldn’t hear it and got a bit upset with me. I am taking on some of this person’s job responsibilities because they can’t fulfill their work duties and my boss is aware. He is aware our customers have complained about this individual and have refused to work with him, so I have to work with his customers as well as my own. 

Promotions were announced this month and I did not receive one. People that I know take it pretty dang easy at their job received promotions and I did not. I am still being paid my base salary with no significant increase in salary.

My boss and I were speaking on a call last week and I told him I was committed to the job and I loved the company and wanted to stay with the company. I told him I wouldn’t mind working here for 10 more years. 

However, I actually broke down and cried when I saw the list of promotions within the company. I have received STELLAR reviews the past couple of years but people that others complain about frequently have received promotions over me. People even are like “Omg how long has it been since you’ve received a promotion?”

I prepped my resume as soon as I saw the list of promotions and I just saw a job I wanted to apply to.

My worry is that I just told my boss one thing and now I’ve done a full 180. I feel like they don’t think I matter and “advocating for myself” didn’t seem to work. 

Would it look bad to anyone but my manager if I jumped ship? Having told him one thing and now changing my mind?

*Edit:* 

Thanks everyone for your advice!

I just wanted to add a couple more details for those wondering what the big deal is. I am super grateful to the company for giving me opportunities I hadn’t had before and I don’t want to appear as if I am not.

I care about the people I work with and that’s part of the reason I work so hard. I was also just raised that way. I take a lot of satisfaction from being good at what I do and helping people. 

I don’t believe my manager is malicious, I just do not think he is proactively pushing for me to get the promotion. He can tell someone I want a promotion but it has to be approved. And he has said before he tries to remain unbiased when considering the talent of his employees…which is part of the issue in this case because his employees are not all equal. There are metrics to prove it. 

There are Glassdoor reviews of this company where people complain of the same thing at this company. Basically, if you’re hard working, you’re rewarded with more work “but it depends on the team”. I took the job anyway because I was offered more money than I ever had been and I figured it was worth the gamble of ending up on a bad team. My team is not bad, but they have no incentive to work harder because people get promoted regardless. Promotion criteria is baffling to many people at this organization. 

Now I am overworked and am getting to the point where I can’t deal with it without some sort of major incentive. But I also don’t want to bite the hand that feeds when the economy is uncertain and if another position doesn’t work out.",2024-08-06 19:40:26,1249,432,0,Positive,0.11134259259259258,0,0,2

I recently found out about the ""International Conference on Textile Design and Critical Fashion Studies (ICTDCFS-24)"" randomly through a Google search for something related.

I found three different pages that announce it. One for Bruges, Belgium; one for Frankfurt, Germany; and one for Berlin, Germany (all different dates). (links below)

Now, I am not sure whether they are legit, because I cannot find any more information about the conference. The summaries/introductions for the conference also seem a bit generic. One even says ""a great way to build networking by engaging in discussion relating to Engineering Topics Topics. (...) Bioinformatics is a great way to build networking""... It seems a bit strange. Especially since the listed topics go way beyond engineering.

What do you guys think when seeing these webpages? Is anyone going? Does anyone know this conference from experience?

1erna3i,careeradvice,Are there viable alternate careers for a 41M food services director? ,"My partner 41M has been feeling trapped in his career path, and is struggling to find positions he can apply for with the experience he currently has. He has been working as a Regional Director for a food services provider. The company he works for assigns him to specific clientele to work with. Previously he his client was a financial/banking institution. He was recently “promoted” to work with a financial technology company. His company tends to smell the blood in the water every time he attempts to leave, and provides him with a “promotion” which includes a pay bump, potential change in the client he’s working with, but no change in title. He says that he feels like this job pigeonholes people into very niche areas, preventing them from leaving or moving up. His complaints include complete lack of professional boundaries from colleagues, as well as clients; virtually no work-life balance, (he’s expected to drop everything for any call/email regardless of the urgency or if he’s on vacation); and no accountability from any department including his higher-ups and middle managers. He finds they people are willing to take credit for work they haven’t done, and throw innocent parties under the bus when they feel the goings getting tough. He takes home ~$200k, but he’s willing to take a pay cut. We live in the Bay Area in California. 

His resume includes these points (details have been redacted for privacy):

* Facilitated the reduction of overall product costs by 12% in the first 90 days of oversight in a $35 million subsidized portfolio.  
* Grew portfolio revenue from $11.3 million to $18.6 million by acquiring two new locations, expanding the catering program, and securing a 5-year contract extension.
* Facilitated the acquisition of two new locations, generating an additional $2 million in revenue. 
* Enhanced the catering program through rebranding, restructuring services, and reconceptualizing the brand. 
* Successfully negotiated a 5-year extension on the client contract, ensuring continued partnership and stability. 
* Established strategic partnerships within the local Bay Area market to enhance brand visibility and collaboration.  
* Improved food safety ratings from third-party safety officers from consistently low levels to 4-5, demonstrating a commitment to quality and compliance.   
* Successfully reduced turnover from 14% to 7% by implementing effective retention strategies and fostering a positive work environment.

Although he’s been applying for operational management type of jobs, he feels like his experience doesn’t translate into viable, stable job options. 

His highest level of education is a BS in Biology, which he received in 2008.

He’s considering getting an MBA, but I’m not sure if that will help boost him out of this rut or give him more opportunities. 

* What kinds of jobs could he be eligible for with the credentials/experience he currently has?
* Would any kind of further education or certification be necessary/worth it? 
* Does his resume require more/less? 
* What kinds of programs would be worth looking into, if any? 
* Any and all advice is appreciated.

TL;DR - my 41M partner feels stuck at a dead end job in the food services industry and is looking for a way out with his experience

About two years later, we acquired a much bigger company with 30+ employees and now it is a few months later and we have even more. 

My title is basically Account Manager, I actually got that title last December but really was doing the work for it 6 months before. 

With this new merger I am the account manager for small clients while the other ones are officially the ones for big clients. 

The thing is, I’m over working with small clients and now my original boss is the CEO and I have a COO in between us. I know my boss trusts me and appreciates me but I feel like there isn’t much room to grow. She’s always insisted that there will be opportunities to grow vertically and horizontally like I’ve asked. Really though I’m not interested in waiting 1-2 years to move up to AM for big accounts then hope 3-4 years later some other kind of position opens. Am I being too impatient? Should I just stick it out for my third year and see where things go?

1er4s5a,careeradvice,Switching jobs 1 year post grad: Am I still entry level? ,"I graduated a year ago with a degree in SCM and started working in a management trainee program. Over the past year, I’ve gained valuable experience, including running a plant team with 20+ employees and working daily with SAP. Now, I’m approaching the end of the program and about to transition into the sales rotation, which is the final stage.

The challenge is, I’m not passionate about sales. I think I might hate it. However, the program requires me to stay in this role for 1-2 years before I can move to another position within the company. Most these roles would still be sales based and I’m realizing unless I love sales this company may not be for me. 

That said, I’m considering pivoting back to a role that’s more aligned with SCM to continue developing my skills in that area. My concern is whether I have enough experience to take on a position beyond entry level. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this situation?

I'm not a woman and I'm not an ethnic minority. So in the name of equality I just don't stand a chance?

Even worse, another position was asking for my religion, my gender, my social gender and my sexual orientation. I know these are useful for some places so as to say ""look we've got a gay guy here we love everybody"" and things like that. BUT it's really nobody's business but mine what I like.

I'm the field of biology/biomedical research. And then it comes to what they ask. PCR (conventional, qPCR, RT-PCR) is not enough. ELISA is also not enough. Cell culture is not enough. Some basic statistics..nope they want more. Teaching experience.. well they don't care. I'm not specialized in anything else. I can make my own primers, find mutations etc but I'm not experienced with sequencing. I'm not experienced with bioinformatics and flow cytometry and lab animals. So I wonder.. does every post doc know all these? Because I don't and nobody seems to care to help you train. They ask for in depth of knowledge of many complicated techniques but they pay is so low.

I just feel bad for myself because I'm a physician and apart from the clinical part I only know PCR, ELISA, cell cultures and toxicity assays and I think I'm not a good applicant for these post docs (In my former post doc I was collecting and analyzing samples with these techniques).

EDIT (I'm adding some additional info)

I'm a physician with a MSc in  Biology and a PhD in cancer biology and I've worked for 3.5 years as a post doc researcher. I always liked research and didn't start a residency because I was imagining myself to have a research career. It just feels that that's how far it gets though.

1epobbw,students,Seeking Feedback on My Thesis Proposal: A Chrome Extension for Image Copyright and Creator Details,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently working on my thesis as a service designer, focusing on the complexities of copyright in the digital age, particularly how difficult it is to find detailed information about images online. To address this issue, I'm proposing a speculative concept for a Chrome extension that would allow users to click on an image and instantly view information about the creator, licensing details, and usage rights.

# How It Works:

The idea is simple: whenever you encounter an image online, you can click on it, and a pop-up will appear with the creator's name, the type of license it falls under (e.g., Creative Commons, All Rights Reserved, etc.), and any other relevant details. The goal is to make it easier for users to understand how they can legally use the image and to give proper credit to creators.

# I’d Love Your Feedback!

As I'm still in the early stages of development, I would really appreciate your thoughts on the following:

1. **Would this be helpful to you?** Do you often find yourself needing to know the copyright or creator information for images you come across?
2. **Would you adopt it?** If such a tool were available, do you think you'd use it regularly?
3. **What features would you like to see?** Are there any additional functionalities that you think would make this tool more useful? For example, would you want the ability to directly contact the creator for licensing requests or have a way to bookmark images for later use?

Any feedback, suggestions, or thoughts you can share would be incredibly valuable as I refine this concept. Thank you so much for your time and input!

I somewhere feel that I also want to study neuroscience. Here after researching a online neuroscience degree is not to be found. According to the UGC guidlines it states that students can do 1 online and 1 offline degree together. But here I'm confused that what if the online degree that's done would be fine or approved if it had to be taken from a university abroad 

So thought of doing a Bsc neuroscience degree from Arizona State University in 2025.( I'm aware of the requirements , entrances etc) . In 2025  I will be in my 2nd year of Bachelor's (psychology). 

My doubts are is it fine if I had to do 1 degree online from a university from America and 1 offline  degree from a university in India . Also as it's late I'll enroll for the bsc degree next year , 2025 . Hence I might finish my bachelors of psychology in 2026 and Bachelors of neuroscience in 2027 .  Will finishing the 2 bachlors in separate years affect me ? And will doing a Bsc degree online from abroad create problems for me here in India?
Thank you so much, please give me your advices or More recommendations. ",2024-07-06 10:10:13,1,1,0,Positive,0.1111111111111111,0,0,2

1enzzwu,university,Feeling lost - seeking guidance - shorter version - PLEASE HELP,"Hey everyone,

I'm 19 and graduated from HS a year ago. I enrolled in a Business undergraduate program at a college here in São Paulo, Brazil (where I live). Earlier this year, I started feeling disconnected from the path I was on.

I’ve always romanticized the idea of living in Europe, so I applied to universities in London, but I quickly realized I didn't have the necessary recommendations due to my less-than-stellar academic history. I wasn't the best student in high school, and I was a part time attendee at best here in college. 

I ended up applying to one university in London that had a high acceptance rate and didn't require recommendations. I got in, but my family was against it, believing I was choosing it for the wrong reasons – mostly to be in Europe to travel and soak up the culture. They also didn’t think it was worth the high tuition, given my academic history. Unfortunately, the plan fell through again, and I couldn’t go.

I scrambled for plans of something to do this upcoming year. I’ve already left my previous university at home, but now I have no clear path forward. I’m so tired of the life I lead here. I don’t have any real friendships, just superficial connections with people I go out with. I’m not learning anything new or seeing anything different, and it’s making me feel stuck. I have a severe case of travel fever, and the desire to see more of the world is eating me up inside. I’ve been to about 8 or 9 countries, but I’m hungry to see more.

Given my current situation, I’m considering taking a gap year to travel. Semester at Sea caught my attention, as it would give me the chance to visit multiple countries, meet new people, and experience different cultures and cuisines. However, since I’m interested in the spring semester, that leaves me with a semester before that to fill. I’m thinking about spending a few weeks in Europe, then heading to the US for a couple of months. I’ve been to New Orleans before and loved it – the unique culture, music, food, and vibe were amazing. Utah also intrigues me with its stunning scenery, national parks, and outdoor adventures.

I’m also contemplating finding part-time work in the US, possibly in sales, marketing, or something related to travel. I’m not looking to make a huge paycheck, anything a little bit above minimum wage would be fine. If anyone has any suggestions or knows of opportunities in these areas, I’d love to hear them.

As much as I want to travel, I know I need to figure out my university plans. I’m torn between pursuing higher education in London, where I could immerse myself in a rich cultural environment, or in the US, where I could possibly explore law or politics – fields that interest me. The idea of sororities and Greek life in the US also appeals to me, and I fear I might miss out on that experience if I choose to study in London.

On top of all these college uncertainties, if I were to continue my business studies, I’d be interested in going into the travel sector. I’m also really interested in the pet sector. The idea of working in the pet sector—whether it’s breeding exotic Pomeranians, owning a luxury pet store, or running a grooming station/daycare—really appeals to me.

I’m also in love with the idea of sororities and Greek life, something I fear I’d miss out on if I went to uni in London. What do you all think? Is it too late for me to start over, to think about a new course or even a new country to study in? Would I miss out on my travel dreams if I studied in the U.S. instead of London? I’d really appreciate any advice or insights you can offer.

But then again, I have doubts about whether I can change my path at this point. I’ve already spent a year in a business program, and my academic history is spotty. I’ve had a rough time with mental health, which affected my grades and attendance in high school. How do I explain that I’ve been floating for the past couple of years? Would any decent school even consider me? Could I start at a mid-level school and work my way up?

So, here I am, feeling lost and unsure of what to do next. Is it too late for me to consider a new course of study or a different country to pursue my education? Would I miss out on travel if I chose to study in the US instead of London? Can I still change my mind about what I want to do with my life?

I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights from those who have been in a similar situation or who have any ideas about how to move forward. Thank you for reading.

1esiyvh,college,"Did average in Chem 2, should I major in Chem?","I'm a biology major considering adding a double major in chem. In summary, I did excellent in chem 1 and did average in chem 2, but I feel very disappointed with chem 2. I'm already set to receive a minor in chem and I already have to take ochem. It would be 6 additional classes to get the double major in chem. But my chem 2 grade makes me feel scared that I won't be able to catch back up with some of the concepts. Should I do it? Also, does ochem or other advanced chemistry (like quant/instrument analysis or enviro chem) courses really hinge off of chem 2?

Background info:

I think my average performance may have happened because it was an accelerated course (6 weeks) and I just did not have enough time to understand and had some other things going on. I also took 17 credits over the summer, but chem was the only one where I wasn't super happy with my grade because like I said, I'm genuinely interested in chemistry. However, I'm scared that it has knocked my confidence in chemistry and that I might not be able to get my understanding where it should be. I have to take Ochem in the Fall anyways, but if I add chem as a second major, I'd need to do it before the spring.

The other component is that my schedule will stay just about as busy when it's time to take the advanced chem courses (the chem courses will take place of an extracurricular thing).

A lot of careers I'm interested in involve an in-depth understanding of chem (ex: I'm interested in going to grad school for toxicology, or maybe pharmacy or optometry school, I enjoy lab work/research).

1enc9lw,college,Why did I get a disbursement without financial aid?,"I've had financial aid for college before, but was put on hold because I failed two classes.This was last fall I think. I took no classes for a while after that.

So this summer semester (2024) I took just one class for around $500 something. Yesterday I got an email talking about about my school receiving and distributing disbursements. Which I thought was weird because I didn't apply or appeal for financial aid. So where did the money come from? Was it from the school itself? Or like ""left overs"" of what I paid for tuition?

I don't think I'm going to touch it till I know it's actually mine.

Like in 2022 I took a class, just one, and received a financial aid disbursement of $2000. At that time I didn't really know how it worked, but figured it was to support me for the rest of the semester. Well I spent a little getting my mom something nice because she supported me with school costs. I buy some new school supplies and what not. Well a week later I get a call from my school that ""the system"" gave me more money than I should have received. I was only to get ⅓ of what I got. So I had to basically pay back $1000+. I luckily didn't spend a lot, but it definitely pissed me off. So even know I'm sceptical of any disbursements.

A PhD student has just been accepted in my small RI (which is part of a small university) studying governance and anti-corruption initiatives in Nigerian politics. I've been asked to come on as a second supervisor because my subject area is governance, Pol Econ and labour (first supervisor is expert on West African culture and politics so the student will have empirical and theoretical support is the idea). However, my expertise is primarily European though that has included work with members of diasporas, including those from West African countries. I am in some ways not the ideal candidate for this supervisory role but given the size of the institution there really aren't any other options. 

 I don't want to recommend things that are unsuitable and/or irrelevant to the specific context the student is looking at. I would also like to orientate myself in the debates in Nigerian politics before the project kicks off. Could anyone here recommend some key authors or texts on Nigerian politics/economy that I can use as a way into the field? It would be very much appreciated!

1e8xq6h,university,Where should I go for my masters,"Hey,

I am currently nearing the completion of my Bachelor's degree in Material Science at RWTH University Aachen. However, I am considering pursuing my Master's degree at a different university.

There are a few reasons for this decision. Firstly, my cohort consists of only six students, which makes it challenging to form friendships. Some students have their own circles, while others lack interest, and I struggle to connect with the rest. Secondly, I find the classes often disorganized, with instances where we are informed about exams just a few weeks before the finals. Additionally, I feel that the effort put into the courses does not correlate well with the grades and ECTS credits received. The demanding schedule leaves barely any time for social life during the semester, and the finals stretch over three months, with the last exam just three days before the next semester starts. All this and I still barely pass. Lastly, the Master's program here is extremely outdated, having last been updated in 2011.

For my Master's, I am looking for an up-to-date program that offers well-structured classes and larger groups of students. I am particularly interested in a more engineering-focused curriculum, as these are the classes I enjoy the most. A university with a strong reputation for its science and engineering programs would be ideal. I am open to studying abroad, as long as the university is in Europe, offers courses in English, and has affordable living costs.

I understand that this decision is ultimately mine to make, but I would greatly appreciate hearing about your experiences and any recommendations you might have as a starting point for my research.

1cn8fpt,academia,PhD (former and current) students working more hours than allowed by their scholarships,"In Australia, PhD scholarships commonly have a condition that students are allowed to work for no more than 8 hours during standard business hours (9am to 5pm) from Monday to Friday. This is not specific to any field of research. Talking to students and staff, the general concensus is that they simply don't tell their University but otherwise make little effort to hide it. For University jobs, they place the additional hours on timeslots outside normal working hours. For non-University jobs, they neglect to tell the University either about the job or that it involves >8 hours during this time. Less commonly, students are even not allowed to do any work during their PhD. I more commonly see this with medical doctors, who combine their PhD with clinical work. For example, I know someone who worked full-time whilst undertaking a PhD full-time, and another who combined a full-time PhD with both part-time work and a Graduate Diploma (at a different University).

From what I have seen online on Reddit (not specific to Australia), university administrative staff care about not exceeding the imposed 8 hour limits during the students' PhD but not afterwards, and would retract the scholarship should the student be caught. Is this true? I do not know of any student or former student (completed PhD or not) who has been singled out for this personally. Even in cases where their work is publicly listed, such as on Linkedin either currently or formerly, I am not sure if this is due to university staff either not knowing about this or simply not caring.

Trying to play devil's advocate I purported that they likely think they are coaching us, or giving valuable feedback, not realizing that it's actually micromanagement. 

It got me thinking that it's not always clear on the difference between the two, but I tried to think in terms of sports, and the analogy that came to me was a coach trying to help a player hit a curveball. 

Coaching in this scenario would be grabbing them after they've struck out, and telling them to watch the laces on the ball or being patient. 

Micromanagement would be telling them how to stand, how to grip the bat, etc, etc, every time they step up to the plate. 

Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that coaching is in the moment, valuable feedback given to someone to help them avoid making the same mistakes. Micromanagement is incessant guidance on how to handle simple tasks that have already been mastered.

1dw9lcx,academia,I am not happy with how my PhD thesis ended. How can I actively rebuild my career now?,"I just recently successfully defended my PhD thesis 6 months ago. It was on a topic that I had absolutely no interest in and motivating myself to write a monograph about it was the most challenging thing that I ever had to do! I almost quit while doing so and became depressed during the last year of my PhD. Thanks to all the support from friends and family, I finished it and will be getting my degree soon.  

But so far, I have zero first author publications. I have quite a few publications where I am in the middle, but I collaborated and contributed to these studies mostly without his knowledge or in situations where he couldn't control/ exclude me from the collaboration. But he did try to passively sabotage it when he came to know. 

I have been having a very bad relationship with my supervisor since the beginning of my PhD. 
He usually completely neglects me while we are alone and he micro-manages me to the extreme when people are around/monitoring us. 

I initially joined this lab because I liked my potential PhD project that we agreed upon. But due to politics, I was forced to work on a topic that I had absolutely no interest in (as my main project).

My supervisor has taken the complete monopoly over publishing my main project where I'm supposed to be the first author., claiming that he will publish it because my written scientific english is horrible and I'm here to 'learn'. But the people who have read what I have written so far have told me that it really isn't that bad as he claims. And writing is very subjective. I think this should be more collaborative. 
This process will definitely help him because he will be the corresponding author. But since it won't be published anytime soon, (he's taking his own sweet time in writing) I also can't use it for applying for Postdocs outside this lab or have an 'edge' while applying for grants (because I would need the publication now, to help me. I also constantly feel like I cheated, as I am not able to do anything for this publication. Hence, I know that I wouldn't get this feeling of ownership or sense of accomplishment when it gets published).

 I am under the impression, that the first author publications will definitely help you in securing the grants that you need and  also on securing Postdoc positions. Its hard for me to find meaning in my PhD thesis. I feel stuck. I feel that I was never able to fully reach my potential during my PhD. How can I get out of this mess? 
Or idk if I should rather just give up on science altogether, because I'm really neither happy nor motivated anymore.  Can anyone  give me their two cents? ",2024-07-05 21:56:01,15,9,0,Positive,0.0520921985815603,0,0,2

6. We work at a tiny coffee table at her place (imagine as a pattern drafter, 1 dress is at least 1 meter???)
7. For the past few days, I have been assigned to edit the pictures from her photoshoot - and she basically not contributing.
8. She has no flexibility in time (1 time we ended 20minutes earlier because she said she had nothing for me to do for the day, but she added a Remark stating that I owe her 20minutes?)
9.

I just joined the brand for 3days and these are actual things that i witnessed.

I just couldn't focus to save my life, even on things that I enjoy. For example I'm trying to learn Hebrew and German and I just can't for the life of me focus on actually learning. I'm either using my phone, or getting distracted over some other pitiful thing. Even when I want to learn something and I choose the subject I still can't motivate myself to learn.

 All I do is walk around aimlessly in circles because apparently I just have trouble sitting down and staying focused for prolonged periods of time. I'm actually walking right now as I type this. I just couldn't make myself give a damn unless there was a deadline right in front of me. I just have that incredible ability to put off pressing things I really should do. I've been told I am smart but lazy multiple times by many people, and just generally for the life of me I can't seem to put in the work, and it makes me feel feel defective.",2024-08-13 20:37:01,19,9,0,Negative,-0.09681657848324515,0,0,0

1er19ar,careeradvice,Feeling Stuck in My Radio Career - Advice Needed,"Hi everyone

I'm a 24F who started working in radio at the age of 19. Initially, I took up work to avoid marriage, but I quickly found something I was genuinely passionate about. I began my career as a radio host in the small town I grew up in, where I hosted a morning show for 3.5 years. I loved the independence and the work—I was always on time, exceeded expectations, and was thriving.

After a while, I wanted to move to a bigger city and a larger station. I got an offer from the company I currently work for (over two years now), but the role was for a producer and an OB jock. Initially, I rejected the offer because I had no experience in those areas. However, the head of state programming convinced me to join, promising opportunities to host shows and produce podcasts, so I took the leap and moved to a bigger city.

For 1.5 years, I worked hard, often on weekends, taking on more than I signed up for. I even received offers from two competing stations for roles that I would typically have to work six years to achieve, but I turned them down because I didn't want to stay in that city.

Eventually, I got the chance to move to Ahmedabad, which was my ultimate goal. But since moving here, things have taken a turn for the worse. I’ve made some mistakes, and now I have far less work than I used to. Most days, I feel stuck, unsure of what's expected of me, and have little to do. I’ve received feedback from my boss pointing out the errors I've made since moving, and I feel like my career is slipping through my fingers. 

I used to be good at my job—people said so. But now, I’m uninterested, frustrated, and not even sure what my role is supposed to be anymore. I still do voiceovers, want to host a podcast, and am trying to revive my social media presence, but I feel lost. I used to be busy all the time, and that's when I thrived. Now, I do whatever’s left after everyone else has done their jobs, and it’s shattering to see how far I've fallen.

I have experience in music management, hosting, and event management, but I’m at a crossroads. I don’t know if I should quit and find something else or try to find a way to make things work here. My mental health is suffering, and I wish I could just crash every time I drive to work. But deep down, I want to be busy again because that’s when I’m happiest.

I could really use some advice. Has anyone else been through something similar? What would you do in my situation?

Thanks in advance.

1dtnokt,students,Would You Pay for a Peer Listener/Coach for Self-Improvement and Mental Health Advice?,"Hi Redditors,

I’m seeking your input on a business idea that I’ve been considering. I’m someone who has been on a journey of self-improvement and personal development for quite some time. Over the years, I’ve accumulated a lot of knowledge and experience in this area. One of my strengths is being a good listener, and I often find myself offering advice and support to friends and family.

This got me thinking – could I turn this into a business? Here’s the idea: I’d offer sessions where I listen to people’s concerns, challenges, and goals related to self-improvement and mental health. I would provide a supportive ear and, when appropriate, share advice based on my knowledge and experience. The goal would be to create a safe space for people to talk about their issues and receive constructive feedback.

I want to clarify that while this might sound similar to seeing a psychologist, my service would be more approachable and easy-going. Think of it as talking to a friend who’s on the same journey, rather than a formal therapy session. It’s about having someone relatable to talk to, without the clinical atmosphere or higher costs associated with professional therapy.

I have a few questions for you:

1. **Would you be interested in paying for a service like this?**
2. **How much would you be willing to pay for a session?**
3. **What would you expect to gain from such a session?**

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this idea. Do you think it has potential? Any feedback, suggestions, or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you for your time!",2024-07-02 14:49:40,1,0,0,Positive,0.20738636363636365,0,0,2

1du3oic,academia,Invited by Professor for Lunch,"Advice needed! I am a graduated highschool student/incoming freshman that is working in a research lab around 40 hours a week (9-5 every weekday). I am the youngest in my lab (F17) and the people closest in age to me are both 4th year undergrad student. I have only been working for three weeks so far, so I am relatively new and others having been working together for a year or longer. There are only 9 people in the lab so everyone in the lab is pretty close. Since most people are PHD grad students, they are considerably older than me so I haven’t been able to get super close. Is kind of weird working with adults as a ""kid"". Especially because everyone works all the time and I step out for lunch since I don’t pack my own lunch. So, my convo with them is pretty limited. But the professor/PI of the lab invited all 9 of us to her house for lunch, and I said yes because I think it’s an amazing opportunity to get to be close/get to know them better, especially because I want to continue working in the lab when the summer is over. But I am vegetarian but no one else in the lab is. She is Iranian so she is most likely cooking Iranian dish or ordering iranian catering (before I joined the lab, the group often dined at iranian restaurant. Also she hasn't decided which one). I dont want her to order something just for me because that will cost her more or have her spend time making me salad or something. Since I am so much younger compared to them and not very close, I don’t want to cause any inconvenience by saying I am vegetarian. So I am not sure what to do. I also don't want to be rude by not eating at a table where everyone else around me is eating becuase I dont want it to be awkward. Also the people that are the closest to me or the two 4th year undergrad students are not coming. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Update: thank you so much to everyone that responded! I really appreciate it. I ended up asking her and she said that she will make sure that there is a vegetarian dish. I was being nervous for no reason lol",2024-07-03 02:37:45,20,11,0,Positive,0.18273984080435693,0,0,2

I started my internship 2 months ago and I have realised my manager is way too peculiar about things. At first I thought I was just bad at designing and brushed it off, but he gets extremely nitpicky and can get very rude at times. He just tells me that, I have a big ego and I am not fluid or open to changes. I have shown my rejected work pieces to my old designing buddies and everyone have failed to find anything bad with it.

I have an inferiority complex, how is it an ego? He calls me 10 times a day with more than 1 task. He'll assign me a major task and within the next hour, he gives me another and expects both to be ready. He sits idly the whole day gossiping about marriages with someone else.  
I am pretty sure the dude above him expects the important designs done by him and the less important things to be done by an intern who is still in their third year of a non-designing bachelor's degree.

1cnmc1o,academia,Do you think that teaching in universities is becoming more difficult and less rewarding for professors?,"I am in the process of deciding whether to stay in academia after my postdoc or take a position in industry. Obviously, teaching occupies a significant portion of a professor's time, so ideally one should enjoy it. However, there are certain aspects, particularly related to the attitude of students that in my opinion make teaching extremely difficult. There was a recent event which I think highlights some of the issues I have noticed during the time I was a TA in my PhD.

Here on Reddit I encountered a post giving voice to some inappropriate comments about a former  
professor, which were made on another platform where students rate their instructors. Basically, several unhappy students anonymously smeared their professor due to academic performance disputes, calling him a ""psychopath"", ""weirdo"", and calling for him to be fired due to incompetency. First, I found it strange that there is an equivalent of Yelp for university courses. I don't want to dismiss bad experiences that students might have in the classroom. However, I think that every university has clear protocols on handling these situations, and going online to smear a professor publicly is a irresponsible way to approach this situation. While this is a rather extreme example, it raised doubts that I have always had in my experience as a TA during my PhD, which are related to the general attitude of students coming into the class. I used the Yelp analogy because most students seem to view the classroom as a place where they go to get another ""service"" for which they have paid certain amounts of money. In doing so, they seem to be entitled to not only get the ideal service, but also the ideal outcome. If either of those things happens at an unsatisfactory level, one is entitled to complain and be rather disrespectful in doing so. Instead of saying that a pasta dish tasted bad and giving the restaurant 1 star on Yelp, they go on these public smearing campaigns on multiple platforms that facilitate this kind of behavior. This seems wildly inappropriate and unfair towards the professors.

But more importantly, I think this kind of attitude is not conducive to a healthy student-professor relationship, which makes certain professors put less emphasis teaching. In my opinion, learning happens primarily as a result of the student challenging themselves, and the professor is someone who can assist them in that process. To me, this is the most crucial aspect of learning, and I don't see how one can do without it. Based on interactions with several professors in my field (STEM), I think that most of them view teaching as a chore and don't get much satisfaction out of it. While this can be viewed as cynical by people outside academia, I definitely understand how maintaining a positive attitude about teaching can be difficult.

I have often heard people talk about teaching being a burden primarily due to other responsibilities to the university and research, but I think that an added factor is the changing perception of the general public towards universities and learning in particular. My experience mainly applies to STEM and I have only been a TA during my PhD, but other fields might be similar. Has anyone had a similar/different experience when teaching at a TA or professor level?",2024-05-09 02:22:21,65,22,0,Positive,0.09454045954045956,0,0,2

They finally called me, but it wasn't to offer me the position, it was to tell me they went with a different candidate; they said that they loved meeting me and also told me they would like to stay in contact for future opportunities but it was really competitive and I just didn't hit their mark.

I’m currently facing a challenging situation at work and could use some advice. I work for a small beverage distributor where I'm the only full-time employee. For the past month, my employer has not paid me, offering a variety of excuses each time I inquire about my paycheck. Some of the excuses include, ""I'm writing your check now,"" ""I left it at home,"" and ""I need sales to pay myself so I can pay you.""

To address this, I have meticulously documented all financial details, including a comprehensive breakdown of amounts owed for each pay period on an Excel sheet. I've also kept records of all text messages and conversations related to previous agreements about pay. While I signed a W-2 when I started, we never formalized the payment, commission structures, etc., in a signed agreement, which I realize may complicate matters.

I have not quit yet because I am in the process of filing a claim with the Department of Labor for lost wages. I’m determined to resolve this and ensure that my rights are protected.

Has anyone here experienced something similar? Any advice on additional steps I might consider to ensure I get the wages I'm owed? I appreciate any guidance you can offer.

I want to continue to pursue my degree but I'm going to need to work. I live in central Florida so living alone would cost $1,500/month or living with a roommate would cost me $900/month, but finding a reliable roommate has been very difficult. 

I will be attending classes this Fall semester on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:15am - 2:45pm and will be taking a total of 4 classes. The rest of the week I am free.

How did you balance a school/work schedule?

What kind of jobs did you have while in school?

1el6rai,careeradvice,Clueless with the direction my career should go in!,"Hello everyone,

I'm a 25 year old who recently did her master's in computer science. I graduated from undergrad with an electronics degree, but wanted to make the switch into machine learning, so decided to make the jump to computer science. I landed a job after my masters as a software engineer in a cybersecurity firm. I occasionally get to dabble with some data science, but that's it. 

Though my interests are in the data science domain, I am not sure if I am good enough for it. Also, I feel just having a background in machine learning may not be enough, but rather I need to focus on more hard core domains like systems or cybersecurity that may use applications of machine learning. 

Somedays I just start to feel like I am not good at anything and I don't know anything and there is so much to learn. I want to learn, but there is just so much out there and I spend so much time not able to focus on a domain. 

This is my first job and it's been a couple of months since I started. Any advice would be really helpful.

Hi I’ve known a professor for a long time. I was his TA too. I have taken 3 classes with him and got A’s in all classes. I was an engaged student and went to all review sessions and also office hours all the time to ask questions. He has also been a great mentor to me.

The last class I had with him we had to give a presentation. I got really nervous and my presentation seemed way worse than everyone else’s both in content and how I presented. It was too short. It was supposed to be 12 minutes but was 9. I am embarrassed. I feel like I worked so hard to have him think of me as a great student but at the end and probably last time I’ll see him it was really bad.

He was my top choice for a professor I could ask for a letter of recommendation from. But now I feel like I totally ruined it by a bad presentation at the end of the semester. I just don’t do good with presentations :/",2024-05-29 06:01:55,1,0,0,Positive,0.040555555555555574,0,0,2

1epd2yp,college,College Finances,"Hey guys, this is my first post here because I'm starting to get a little confused regarding my college tuition. Fair warning, this is a really really really long post, and might belong on something like r/personalfinance 

Right now, my tuition for school without FAFSA loans is 15,772$, and with FAFSA loans it is 10,272$

The job that I am working for gives a 40% tuition reduction on top of a \~5,000$ tuition reimbursement for the school year. I would be able to pay off the school year with this job, savings, and parental assistance, so that isn't a thing to consider when talking about taking on loans. I don't need to pay housing or any bills at home (living with my Asian parents for free)

ASSUMING THE PERCENTAGE IS PLACED AFTER THE REIMBURSEMENT:

Option 1: I don't accept my FAFSA loan and my tuition for the year ends up being 15,772$. My job pays me 5000$ in reimbursement, and 4308.80$ in percentage. This means 9308.80$ in saved money. I would pay my college 6463.20$ total.

Option 2: I accept my FAFSA loan and my tuition for the year is 10,272$. My job still pays me 5000$ in reimbursement, and 2108.80$ in percentage. This means 7108.80$ in saved money. I would pay my college 3163.20$ total. The ""extra money"" that could be saved is 3300$. Technically ""lost"" 2200$ in savings, plus loans in the future.

ASSUMING THE PERCENTAGE IS PLACED BEFORE REIMBURSEMENT

Option 3: I don't accept my FAFSA loan and my tuition for the year ends up being 15,772$. My job discounts my tuition to 9463.20$ and then reimburses me 5000$. This leads the total saved money to 11308.8$. I would have to pay 4463.20$ in the end.

Option 4: I accept my FAFSA loan and my tuition for the year is 10,272$. My job discounts my tuition to 6163.2$ and then reimburses me 5000$. This leads the total saved money to 9108.8$. I would be able to pay only 1163.20$ in tuition. The ""extra money"" that could be saved would be 3300$. ""Lost"" money is the same as well, and the same loans too.

This means if I were to accept FAFSA loans, each year I would technically have an extra \~1100$ net saved, but also 5,000$ in loans each year. Pretty much a net -3900$ loss every year? 

If I were to put that net savings (the +1100$ a year without including loan cost) into something like a HYSA to pay back those loans in the future, there would be no way that I would be able to pay off those loans out of college. This isn't even considering the new graduate school loans I would be taking on after my undergraduate.

Based off of my 18 year old math, as well as simplifying to ignore stuff like taxes and inflation (I have no clue how that would affect my math), would it not be automatically be better to avoid the loans? Please let me know if my logic actually doesn't make sense at all. I worked pretty hard on these numbers and the thought process, but I would rather be told I'm stupid than people blindly agreeing with me.

TL;DR: Do I take on FAFSA loans even if I can pay my tuition without it?",2024-08-11 05:24:11,1,3,0,Positive,0.06607278138528137,0,0,2

1dj6sud,academia,Taking LOR Rejections Personally,"Hi Professors!

I'm hoping to tap into the collective wisdom here and get some advice since I'm sure most of you get LOR requests frequently. I graduated in 2021 with a degree in Advertising (very large public university). It's been about 3 years since I graduated and now I am doing a career change with the dreams of becoming a Social Worker and Behavior Analyst (BCBA). Right now, I work with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and I LOVE my job. To do this career change, I will need a Masters of Social Work. All the MSW programs REQUIRE at least one academic recommendation from undergrad and ALL my old professors have declined my requests.

I did well in undergrad (got As in all my classes. 3.7/4.0 overall gpa) but I struggled a lot with my mental health in college and due to this, was quite shy, so I didn't make strong relationships with my professors. I would attend office hours occasionally with my professors, but when I was there I was very much talking about class and had questions about assignments, I wasn't doing a ton of small talk/get to know you talk.

In addition to this, half of my college career was impacted by COVID (all classes suddenly moved online). Since graduating, I've worked a lot on my mental health and am not very shy any more, but I do know that I am quite a sensitive person (which is something I'm personally working on in therapy).

Here are some answers I got after reaching out to old professors...

""I don’t think it would be wise to give a recommendation for you.  Although you were a student, it was almost six years ago.  We also haven’t talked that much in that time and I haven’t seen your progression either.  I would have limited input on how to recommend you outside of your grade and I think you need to find people who would be able to do that.""

""I need to know how a student works and thinks on a daily basis in order to write a meaningful letter of recommendation. Otherwise, it will just be a recap of your resume and a grade spreadsheet, and that won't help you at all. Therefore, while I appreciate your asking, I have to decline.""

While I completely understand where they are coming from on this and I appreciate their honesty, I feel discouraged and a bit bad about myself. I know this is coming more from insecurity rather than my old professors, but I feel like a not good enough student. I feel so passionate about my new career dreams and more than that, I want make people feel seen and understood and I want to help children grow and live more independent lives. I feel lost on what to do next, as every MSW program requires 1 academic recommendation. I feel super confident in my professional recommendations, but it seems I'm stuck when it comes to academia.

Does anybody have any advice they would be willing to explain to me? Even words of encouragement would help! One idea I had was maybe in the fall 2024, I could take some ASL and Spanish classes at my local community college and that professor could possibly write me one (although this would push back my masters degree and be hard financially since I'm saving for my masters).

Additionally question - just because I'm curious, as professors, how would do you prefer students to respond to rejections? I'm assuming of course, be polite and understanding, is there anything else you would appreciate in a response email?

What are emotions? Emotions are energy in motion. A strong release of/drawing in of energy into/from the universe.   


  
So how can we use them for our benefits?  


  
The most important thing to know is that your emotion matters because they are ALWAYS attracting things to you that match your emotional output. And similar to a radio frequency, you cannot hear the FM station if you are tuned into the AM station.  


  
For example. Over the years, I've had encounters from Angels and non-physical beings, who explained to me, that they had been trying to contact me for a while but couldn't even reach me because of my low vibration(negative emotions) at that time.  


  
This showed to me how important our emotional output is, if we desire to be in a position to receive anything, from the events of the universe put in motion, that comes from a higher vibrational side.  


  
One thing to consider is how we can feel an impressive euphoric energy at will through the activation of our spiritual energy. It is that energy that is most easily felt with goosebumps from positive situations/stimuli.  


  
(Keep in mind though that goosebumps should only be used as a checkpoint to understand/experience this euphoric energy and that this energy can be learned to be brought up without the goosebumps. Leaving us in control of this blissfully wave.)  


  
This energy has been acknowledged in many cultures and documented under many names like Bioelectricity, Life force, Prana, Chi, Qi, Orgone, Rapture, Tension, Aura, Euphoria, Ecstasy, Mana, Vayus, ASMR, Nen, Intent, Tummo, Odic force, Kriyas, Pitī, Frisson, Ruah, Spiritual Energy, Secret Fire, The Tingles, on-demand quickening, Voluntary Piloerection, Aether, Chills, Spiritual Chills and many more to be discovered hopefully with your help.  


  
If you understand how important it is to be able to bring this positive energy up whenever you need to, here are [three written tutorials](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiritualchills/comments/16s11tn/benefit_from_your_spiritual_energy_starter_pack/) this euphoric energy.

1eriuof,careeradvice,Is it worth it to consider this job?,"So I've been trying to break into Data Analysis. I've learned a lot from the google certificate.

I've been applying to entry level roles just to get a feel for it. I was surprised when one gave me a phone interview. I have some transferrable skills. I've worked with Data in a contact center environment. I work in the financial industry with a lot of spreadsheets and sometimes data.

Anyways, this role is basically what I make currently, 60k.

Looked up the company, it looks like they have a rather outdated business model and are struggling to adapt. They have mixed reviews on Glassdoor and Indeed.Most everyone seems to say the company has great people and work life balance. A lot of griping about turnover and layoffs, low pay.

I don't know how stable my current role is. It's definitely not rock solid. Plenty of work that we do is being automated and offshored, and there's an uncertain future for our group.

It sounds like they want to just toss you out there with minimal training and see if you sink or swim. The recruiter gave me a lot of detail. She said it would start with owning a specific system of customer contact information and working with one of their vendors on that data.

But then they want to expand it into Adhoc projects.

It seems to have generous PTO, and 7 hour days for a salary job, which I've never heard of anyone doing.

It sounded promising, she claimed she only had one other person to phone screen and they didn't answer the call. I wonder if it's because they look like a bit of a sinking ship from the outside.

If I managed to get through a year how big could the payoff be? Does a year hands on even mean anything in terms of getting a better paid role?

1eol7v6,academia,Managing Limited Library Access During a Gap after PhD/Alumni Library Access Workflow ,"I am in a tricky situation, which I guess many other people here have faced, so I thought this would be the best place to ask for advice. I am currently in the midst of a six-month gap between finishing my PhD and starting a postdoc, which means I have temporarily lost full library access. However, I still have alumni access to certain databases from both my undergraduate and PhD programs, though it is a bit of a patchwork—one account has access to Sage and Springer, another to Project Muse, etc.

To access these resources, I have to go through each institution's alumni page and log in separately, which makes it difficult to search across all databases efficiently.

Right now, I usually start with Google Scholar and then try to guess which resource might have the article, but this approach is time consuming and not always effective. Has anyone else faced a similar situation? If so, did you find any strategies to streamline the process of searching and downloading articles across multiple platforms? Are there any tools that can help? I tried Libkey, but it defaults to the active student account: when I click download, I get the message that my account does not have access to the resource. I am stuck doing the whole process manually.

1d3hl4h,academia,How important is the writing itself of a paper?,"I recently finished my PhD and was re-reading my first paper. And it struck me how it is… badly written. Now the paper had a very torturous genesis, having material cut off and being more or less entirely rewritten. It wouldn’t help that my supervisor would cut significant portions and rewrite sentences. Sometimes I had to go back and make sure everything made sense. But I was very busy with lots of things and sick of working on that paper, and so I admit I could have done a more thorough job at going through the text again after my supervisor made his corrections.

I would say the main issue is that the writing is kinda… ugly. Too many commas, sometimes not enough, sometimes at weird places, too many repetitions, etc. Now I am pretty happy about the content, but not so much the writing. I am rather a perfectionist and an admirer of good prose, and get bothered quite a bit by these things. I was wondering, does this hurt your paper‘s ability to be read and its results disseminated?

1cxti8f,academia,My college professor sent me an inappropriate text after I told him I couldn’t make it to class because I was sick.,"I (24f) have known my professor (70-80m) for about 6 months now. I took a law class with him in the fall and now I’m taking another with him in the spring. Back in the fall we had a few good conversation about the law, personal interests, and the class, and he seemed to have grown a liking to me. I thought it was cool since he’s a lawyer and a law professor and I thought I could learn a lot from making this good educational connection like internships meeting other lawyers and just having a good recommendation. I remember in the fall I sang the national anthem at a conference at my school in which he attended and when he saw me after he kept saying how amazing it was. I just thought it was a regular compliment as I was told that by many others that day as well. Anyways fast forward to this spring semester, he seemed very happy to see me in his class and after class he always made small convo. I stayed for a little then left. I remember one time we walked to the parking lot while still talking and he said “You’re quite the sight for sore eyes” and I just awkwardly laughed and said thanks. I didn’t think much of it since he’s literally so old to me (he looks 80) and it gave grandpa vibes. So I went on with my day. As the semester has kept going, one time he asked me if I’d like to go out for drinks and I was like oh sure without thinking as I was in a hurry to leave. At the time I was like maybe it was just a chill gesture and we can talk more about the law or he’s going to give me a law opportunity, but after I mentioned this to some people they said that was a strange thing to ask. Fast forward a few weeks he ended up mentioning it again after class (I said I was busy), he called me one day to ask if I was available to go out for coffee (I said no), he called again to ask the same thing a couple weeks after (I said no), then he texted me on email (I don’t even remember why) saying that he hopes I do well in the class and that he thinks I’m a beautiful, smart, intelligent woman who makes him smile, and I never replied. The last thing that happened that honestly has me in complete shock is this text message that I am posting on here. I had texted him (yes texted because he has texted me on there before and since he’s older he doesn’t check emails or canvas as often) that I was going to miss class and that I was still planning on turning in the work I needed. He proceeds to reply the following that you see in the post. When I read the “Perhaps I can pleasure you back to feeling a whole lot better” my entire body froze and I felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to post this on here to see if others think this is inappropriate as well and what my next steps should be? I immediately thought I should report him but is this enough proof to get him expelled? Something like this has never happened to me, I truly can’t believe he’d be so blunt. Could it be he’s just really old and doesn’t realize how horribly wrong this sounds or is he just a weirdo that needs to be put in his place? Please let me know.

Not my worries for now. I’m thinking about doing a research on the eating disorders anorexia and bulimia nervosa, considering how popular it’s between teenagers I believe? As well as the idea that I might be suffering of some type of ed but my parents definitely wouldn’t realize it. I’ll never forget dad yesterday when I just didn’t want to eat and her said “are you planning to be the object/subject of your research?!”. That hurts. Anyways, do you think doing a research about those two is a good and a scientific topic? 
Keep in mind I need to write 4 topics and I don’t want something silly.  I’m very convinced with the eating disorder topic but.. if I did it, what exactly am I researching? My teacher said for me to find out what body system they effect, etc. Also I know eating disorders are related to mental health and all. And like the idea planted in the head of ppl to have the perfect weight and the guilt after eating (I get that, a lot. Makes me hate my body) in bulimia nervosa causing the ones suffering from it to engage in purging acts to flush out their guilt.
Do you think this is a great topic to discuss and research about? I’m excited to do it, feeling that I can relate to it at least a bit makes me feel better. Are there any other topics in mind for me to do that have to do with mental health or so? 
Off topic but doing science fairs since 5th grade has been a really nice experience. What made me upset is my inability to find a winning topic/project that I can enjoy AND take me places. Last year I did “Chocolate Melting Dynamics”. As silly as it sounds, I only did it because it was easy and fun. I wish I was able to find OR EVEN create awesome and scientific ideas, but I was never able to. It felt horrible not being able to make my teacher as proud as other first place winning students do. My presenting is amazing and my board is always neat and on point and she likes that about me. I only ever suffer the ideas. She even wants me to participate in science fair this year besides symposium and I want to too. But I don’t want to embarrass myself since it’s now optional.

1cr7335,academia,Habilitation? (Germany based),"So, this question is mainly for Germany based academics.

Long story short, I am too (academically) old for the junior professorships and had to make a (way too big) gap due to caregiving responsibilities. I am now trying to get back in track, started a new postdoc, working on a grant, etc. 

I have been looking at w2 (~associate) positions, which I think is the right level atm for me, however they require some proof like a jun.prof., having a group, or a habilitation.

Due to my situation habilitiation is the most realistic option for me I think. However, I find it a bit hard to understand the system. My current postdoc is in a HS and I wonder if I can reach out to some professor in a Uni and ask to do a Habilitation there?

Any thoughts/experiences in the matter are welcome!

I am considering going to university as a mature student (over 21). I would really like to go to a top university in the UK and lots of them require evidence of “recent study”. I finished school at 18 ( three Bs at A level) and went into a finance apprenticeship with a large company in the UK and did a level 3 qualification (finished in 2022). Then I went travelling and had some casual jobs and am now having a minor existential crisis as to what direction to take my life. 

So to get to the point, what “recent study” can I do to set myself apart? Would this be a type of course I can enrol on? A project I can start?

That included jumping jobs because of these moves. I went to school first for my associates degree in biology and got a bachelors degree in botany with a natural resources minor. My goal was to work in the state park here in Pennsylvania as a park manager. My degree is perfect for the position but it requires a move which my fiance doesn’t want to do as he makes 80k+ even though he says he doesn’t want to do his job forever. The park manager job starting would be around 45k for the trainee spot for about a year and probably around 60k starting with a park. This position would come with housing for a really cheap price though. Because of this situation, I need to find jobs with my degree around the Pittsburgh area, and for needing at least 60k because of the debt I am in, I can’t even find something around it.

1eidkev,careeradvice,Need advice!,"

This may be a long one but just need some advice…

I started working for my company ~5 years ago in January 2020. I started with one role department A and then received a promotion within the same department in 2023. I loved the department and what I was doing, had great colleagues and great bosses and really felt like I was doing well and making a difference, felt valued etc. 

Then I received an offer (for a lateral move)  from a different internal department doing similar type of work but in a completely different side of the business, in a more global setting. I really went back and forth on this for a LONG time and was really unsure what I should do, but ultimately decided to take the plunge and try it out. Since this is a large global company I work for, I thought it would be good to diversify my skills and learn new things to keep adding to my resume. 

Now I’m six months into this new role and really just not clicking with it. It was sold differently in the interviews, the environment is more toxic and political and I feel as though my best skills really aren’t being utilized. 

Fast forward to this week, my old boss reaches out to me and advises me that there is a lead position coming to my old department to be posted next week and they would love for me to apply and to have me back if I would want to do so - which is great news right? But I just feel really stuck! I feel terrible that it’s only been 6 months so I can’t imagine what my new team would feel after all the training and I can’t imagine that my new boss would be impressed that I’m wanting to go back to my old team. I also don’t know how that would look to everyone - would they think I was regressing? Is it really unprofessional of me? (I know I shouldn’t worry about what others think, I’m just more scared of burning bridges..)

My company does not have any rules or restrictions about when you can apply for internal positions so no worries on that front, the managers just have to come to a mutual agreement.

1emt7cs,careeradvice,What is your advice on how I should proceed in my career?,"Life / previous job context:

Recent graduate with a degree in Information technology. I had an internship for about a year and a half as a National IT Support Analyst (same thing then but needed it for school) after which I took a 3-month break cause I was drained and finished up my degree after which I took another job at a tax center (contracted not sure if it matters) in which I had so a bad break down after a month in that I decide to quit. Fast forward 6 months of looking for a remote job cause that's what I believe makes a job bearable for me with no success I landed an in-person call center-type role at a bank.

My issue:

I recently started to work I get depressed during and after work (9 to 5) every once in a while I get this nauseating feeling of why am I doing this, what the purpose is, and in general feel trapped almost. It has only been two days and it is just orientation and training I sit at my desk and just click nothing hard, the coworkers are nice, and management hasn't really spoken with me but from what I can see everyone is nice I even made a friend although not close. Everything seems to be going well I just don't get what this trigger of sadness or depression is. Am I just lazy and don't like work? So now I'm thinking if I should quit but if I do what would I do I can't live without money for the rest of my life.

Other potential Ideas on why I'm feeling this and potential resolutions that I thought of:

* I have thought about maybe just working for my family at their restaurant maybe this is a good idea for some reason I think that getting criticized by my parents is better. ( weird)
* I could just be lonely at work or maybe I don't find myself with a sense of belonging and that could be my cause of unhappiness.
* I also may have the option of starting a restaurant or a cafe of some kind which I would ask my parents from my parents along with taking a loan but this is very much an out-there thought.

Sorry kind of a long post this is most definitely something that I can just suck up and do in the cost of some mental but I'm just feeling sad and lost. I am hoping to find something to solve my issue, a remedy, or another option in life where I don't feel this way. I would like to deeply apologize if I sound like I'm just whining.

Side Note: For anyone suggesting things along the lines of work-life balance and focusing on what makes me happy after work and finding something to look forward to outside of work I thank you for the suggestion in advance but this does not work for me. I've been going to the gym every day, I've tried jotting down my thoughts in a journal, and I've taken vacation. None of it helps sadly.",2024-08-08 01:21:14,1,0,0,Positive,0.024664830119375578,0,0,2

I didn't necessarily seek out this opportunity, it just kind of happened. I don't find myself aligned with the company mission and ultimately their goals don't align with my values. 

This being said, I really enjoy working with my boss and he has put himself put there to try and get me a full-time role at the company. 

I had an interview for my dream job and didn't get it, however I met with the hiring manager again after and he has been passing around my resume and has told me they are hiring again in early winter for a very similar position.

Ultimately, I don't want to continue working at my current company for 2 months and then quit on my boss after he has put his name in the ring for me. I do want to work at my dream job (obviously), and would drop my current roll in a second if given the opportunity.

1csn3gz,academia,Getting a PHD in mechanical engineering (or a similar field) to work as a Professor of Engineering in the Middle East.,"  
Hello, I am a UK Citizen currently about to graduate in less than a month with a Integrated Masters of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from a prestigious UK university.

I have interests in CAD, Design Work, FEA, Mathematics (Especially Calculus), Robotics, Additive Manufacturing and Physics in general.

After visiting the middle east a few times, I have a desire to possibly move there within the next 5-10 years. I believe the developments in the Middle East especially in academia will reach the level of Europe and the rest of the world within the next 10-20 years.

My question is, is it worth me pursuing a PHD in the UK/US/Europe, then becoming an assistant professor at a university either in Europe/US/ ME and then finally working towards becoming a full time professor in the UAE or other Middle eastern countries? Is there a big enough scope and would I even be wanted there?

My first semester (last winter semester) went pretty okay, I didn't fail any graded exams/assignments, half of my grades were good, the other half average, but that's okay in my books, it's my first year and the transition from school to university is hard. However, the current semester sucks. I am pretty sure I failed an exam I took last week (don't have results yet), and in about 3 hours I'll write an exam I'll most definetly fail (I know like three out of seven chapters of material). I can retake them with no issues, but still. I used to be a slightly above average student, and failing exams is not something I'm used to. It's frustrating, especially since I know I'm technically capable of being a good student, I'm smart enough, Iove studying, I love my degree, and I'm aware how privileged I am to be able to go to university. I just fucked up time management this exam period and hardly studied at all. I learned from my mistakes and am more motivated to get disciplined and develop healthy and sustainable habits than ever, but I'm still not able to save those two exams. I'll retake them in a couple months and not suffer significant consequences (I can retake every exam once without it causing any issues), but I still feel like a failure. I have friends who failed more exams and are still fine, and I don't think they're failures, it's just me. I'm rambling a bit but I need to get this off my chest or I'll cry in the exam hall. I feel so bad and guilty.

I am an HR professional (26 years old) living in Iraq. I have been working with a tech start-up for the past two years. I have left on good terms, however, there's been a legal issue; they haven't paid me any social security dues or even registered me (iny country, social security dues are paid by companies monthly to ensure secure retirement).

I am thinking of suing them to claim my social security benefits (it is an easy case, affordable, and a guaranteed win as per the 5 lawyers I consulted).

I have been really hesitant about this...There has been a change in management and they attempted to reduce my salary and bring a senior officer who I'll be reporting to. Salary reductions are illegal as per my labor law, however, I didn't want any trouble, so I quit politely and found a better job.

I am not bitter towards my ex employer at all, however, will this be a red flag in future background checks? Suing my ex employer isn't an easy decision and while it is a confirmed win, I am uneasy about how this will affect future job opportunities.

I have always had an interest in learning how I can make things faster and easier for work... I've always had that craze in me to be different and do things differently which has always given me an edge over all my other classmates.. here is a list of some AI tools that i used to make studying 100 times easier for me-

1. Quillbot - This is the AI tool that has helped me soooo much in English AP with novels and typical English phrases. There are times when you don't know what the meaning of a word is and when search it online, It just doesn't make sense!!! Quilllbot accept sentences or paragraphs and provides alternative versions that retain the original meaning but use different phrasing.QuillBot offers many modes, including Standard, Fluency, Creative, and more, catering to various writing needs. Each mode provides a different spin on the content, allowing students to find the tone and style that best suits their work.QuillBot can suggest synonyms for specific words, aiding students in diversifying their vocabulary and enhancing the richness of their content.

2.Querium- This very good compact AI tool is The ""ChatGPT"" specifically for students. It utilizes AI to figure out where the pupil is having issues and afterward creates individualized improvement plans.  This responds to questions from students and offers specific comments.

3.Mathly - No doubt, best AI for maths....

4.  Explain Like I'm Five - Exactly what the name says...  Explain Like I’m Five, or ELI5, provides simple, clear, and direct answers to some of life's most complicated questions, whether that's a complicated quantum physics concept or the difference between weather and climate.

1en8ttx,careeradvice,My manager is like a neglectful absent parent ,"I’m new-ish in my career (in my 20s) and started my job 3 months ago. And I really don’t like my manager’s management style

He is constantly in meetings or travelling for work to have meetings in person (it’s a global company)

He takes forever to respond to messages/emails and sometimes he just never responds 

He is always on his phone/writing emails, including when we are in a meeting together & during our 1-to-1’s

He never checks on what my workload looks like, but then I’ll get emails like “hey I spoke to [manager] and he said you could help me with X”

He constantly gives me huge tasks to complete and then tells me to ask another person in the department if I need help. The person in question is a godsend and very willing to help when I ask, however the lack of interest in training/helping me do my job properly in my first 3 months (which I though was part of the purpose of a manager) leaves a sour taste in my mouth 

He seems like someone who overvalues “facetime” and likes to look busy, as opposed to actually being busy.

I get the sense that he has found a job where he doesn’t really have to do much but still gets to be seen as valuable somehow. And he hired me so he would have a direct report to further legitimise this reputation 

To be honest I’m posting this partially to vent. But also, what should I do? Is it possible I’m totally wrong? Should I talk to him? Or should I just start on my exit plan?

2 of these 50 participants are completely ruinning my results. When they are removed, I get literally picture-perfect results.

Is there a way for me to get rid of those two participants? Any insights would be much appreciated!

I'm a 35F seeking advice. I have a bachelor's degree in Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering from India and a master's in Electronics Engineering & Engineering Management from Australia. I've never failed a course and maintained a CGPA above 7.8, though I'm not sure how relevant that is. I also have one year of experience in academic research during my postgrad studies, with a published journal article. 

Unfortunately, I've had a 7-year career gap. I'm an average learner and feel unsure about my next steps. I'm wondering if there’s a job where my educational background could be an asset. What should I learn to upskill? I have some interest in machine learning and am open to exploring fields where I can use both technical and management skills. 

Currently, I’m feeling a bit lost and under-confident. I need a work-from-home option due to an autoimmune disorder that limits my mobility during flare-ups. I’ve also been on psychiatric medication for MDD and PTSD for the last 6 years. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

**Additional Notes**

Half my life feels like it’s passed by, and I’m unsure where to begin. I’m fortunate to have a wonderful spouse who supports me through it all. For the last 5 years, I've been living with my parents as a caretaker, but I'm hoping to move in with my spouse soon ( currently he is finishing his post doctoral research )

Although I'm financially stable due to an inheritance, I don't want to be a homebody—I’d really like to start a career.

Imagine if I would apply to Us and into top 30 world uni and UK only top 70 world uni that would be cool but then if it turns the other way round I would have just wasted so much time on applications when could have more time for myself or my IBDP.

1dbcolz,academia,Tenure track vs adjunct career paths,"I am a career k-12 special educator (10 years, 33yo) who is a recent doctoral grad from a large, well known university. I am about to move back to my smaller, less populated state and am working out what exactly I want to do for work. My current org has offered me a part time, remote role supervising the program I just created and launched last year, so I have 2-3 days per week free to pursue other things.

I've done many different, interesting jobs in k-12 (resource teacher, inclusion specialist, general ed teacher, behavior program teacher, instructional coach, director / creator of district program, and various leadership positions along the way), and I generally think I have a lot to offer in my home state. They are far behind in inclusion, plus my recent orgs have done things like project based learning and mastery based grading that would be very valuable for them. 

My instinct is to try working for myself, offering PD directly to schools who want to learn how to implement inclusion, PBL, MBG, etc. This would be especially valuable in rural areas that have no access to it. It seems like I should keep my part time gig and try to make it working for myself this way... However, a new opportunity just presented itself. 

I contacted some old teaching partners and professors back home, and I was basically told that I should apply for a tenure track professor job that is about to open up. This is not something I've really considered before, though I think I would do well in such a role. I had only ever really thought about working in an adjunct role while I established myself as a consultant / PD provider. 

But a tenure track professor... that sounds like a lot of work for not that much money (I think I'll make more as a district admin?). It also sounds like I'd have to hit the brakes on my personal venture offering PD, as well as my hobbies (BJJ, Bonsai, Backpacking, Reading). I'm really looking for some career advice and feedback from people working in academia, particularly within education. I need to figure out how I should consider the possibility of working as a career university professor, as that will certainly mean saying 'NO' to many things I want to keep in my life. Not to mention... I will be starting a family soon and would love nothing more than to be present for my children. 

Any advice or personal anecdotes will be greatly appreciated.

At first, i was very excited, because the pays are considered decent, not to mention all the benefits i will receive as a staff. But 1 month into the job, i already feel like the work im doing is pretty underwhelming, and does not requires any degree at all. 

a few of the tasks are (Based on the paperwork given):  
1. Monitor all data, and ensure everything is working fine, otherwise, i need to escalate those issue to their respective department. (i still have no idea what those data represent, even asked a few of my friends and they themselves dont really know what those datas are)

2.  Set a daily backup using the IBM Data Cartridge, and i need to use a windows command to activate those backup. 

3.  Monitor policies using Dell Networker, and ensure every workflow up and running, otherwise i need to rerun the particular workflow, and up until 8:00am if the error still persist, i need to submit a ticket to the respective department. 

4. Monitor other countries (only 2) end of day batch processing, and again, if an error happened, i need to contact person in charge

5.  i have to remote access 4 of the main pc and make sure every processing is down by 12:00 AM, and make sure its up again for use by 8:00 AM. 

6. I have to remote access this one particular pc and make sure all important files there are at a current date

7.  At 7:00 AM, i have to set this one server machine up for a backup, and ensure there are no error during the process, otherwise, same thing, i need to escalate those issue. 

There are a lot more, but im sure these will give you general idea of how the task for my role is.  
As you can see, all the tasks given to me is something people would consider not a high skill ceiling job. Now dont get me wrong, im forever grateful for the job i have right now, its easy, yet pays so well, but to compare it with my friends, who have a much challenging job, makes me feel guilty. Most of them are either a programmer, or working in a security department, which is something respectable. 

If you guys are wondering how i landed on this job, in the interview, i did tell them that i would like to explore other options other than programming/tech support and they asked me right away, are you comfortable with working shift? to which i responded YES. 

Sorry for the long text, but i would really appreciate if you guys give your thoughts on this, or am i just overthinking? ",2024-08-07 19:53:47,1,0,0,Positive,0.1281119929453263,0,0,2

1er0rz0,college,Advice Needed - First-year College Homesickness (Considering Changing Colleges),"I'm an undecided major at Tulane University, I'm Vietnamese, and I'm introverted. I moved into my dorm a little less than 2 days ago and I instantly started breaking down and crying a few hours after my parents left. I love my parents more than anything in the world and the feeling that I won't see them as much as I did over the last 18 years of my life devastates me. I don't think that I am emotionally or personally ready to be away from the people I love. Furthermore, it's even harder to find people that I can connect with because of Tulane's student body of predominantly white population and rich socioeconomic backgrounds (I grew up/am pretty poor). My brother and friends online have been helping me with the change, but I still feel depressed, anxious, but more calm than before. I've been reconsidering going to my state school at LSU which has a more diverse student body. If I do go to LSU then I can live with my parents (which live around 30 minutes away from LSU campus), get around $8k a year from financial aid, and learn to become more independent gradually. If I stay at Tulane (1 hour 30 minute drive from my parent's place) then I pay around $700 a year (which is very affordable and comfortable for me and my family). I don't really care about the location (New Orleans is nice, but its not that amazing in my opinion as a Louisiana native). I have to decide the big question by this Thursday because of LSU's orientation: Do I go stay at Tulane or live with my parents and go to LSU? I have been also considering of going to LSU for two years then transferring out somewhere else once I have decided/found my major.

I was having this negative viewpoint of ""I feel that I will be happier in LSU"" which my brother pointed out. I am going to give Tulane one more chance to see if I really believe that I can be happy here. I am writing this to see what y'all think about my situation and what college I should go for.

1cphell,academia,How to deal with unwanted teaching assignment?,"Next semester, I'm being asked to teach a course that I have no interest in (a CS course about databases in a master degree aimed at humanities students, this is in Europe). 

Last time I had anything to do with databases was when I took the equivalent course when I was a student about 20 years ago. My background is antipodean: HCI and Virtual Reality.

Unfortunately it seems I might not be able to get out of this. The fact remains I have no interest in spending time on this course long term. If the professor is the first to be uninterested in the course, this will of course not be great for students either and how the ""origin story"" of many people who dislike academia starts.

Do you have any advice from similar past experiences?

I see the following options:

1. If I accept but ask this to be reviewed next year, they will of course agree but in reality I might be stuck with this until the next sucker comes along.

2. I accept but ask for extensive changes to the course. It unfortunately cannot deviate too much from the area of databases. So effectively I would have to create a lot of new content in some way related to databes in some way. Not great either and there's the potential that someone asks me to backtrack on this.

3. I accept and teach the course as is hoping that the existing materials are decent while spending the minimum amount of time on it. See student origin story epilogue.

4. I refuse and accept unforeseen consequences. The only way I could realistically refuse is if there somehow are no existing materials. In that case I think I would be at least partly justified in refusing to create entirely new materials from scratch for something I have really no interest in.

I am saddened because there are many other potential courses I would be truly happy to teach. But of course they have to force me to do something I am saddened even just thinking about it.

So what do you think would be the best way to react going forward?

I apologise if this feels egotistical (""you are lucky to even have a job!1"") but from a mental health perspective, being forced to do something I really don't want is not great either. The moment I stop doing what I am passionate about is the moment I will stop loving academia.

For context, I just finished my Ph.D last month and was offered a temp position as a Lecturer/Researcher at the university I was in.

My director wants to implement our work in the domain of Energy, starting with lithium batteries in relation to EV. As for before my Ph.D, I have a bachelor in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and a Masters in Computer and Communication.

1epube6,college,I'm Lost.,"I'll start by saying this, I have had an overall negative experience at my school. I bounced around my first two years not knowing what to do. The advisors here were no help because when I would go to them expressing that I was not enjoying my major they would just have me change my major to the thing I was interested in most at the time. I did this four times. I finally took a test at the end of my sophomore year saying that the top 3 majors I would do best in where ""Biochemistry, Biology, or Chemistry"". I did plenty of research on these and ended up deciding on biology, once I did they told me I couldn't do it with the time I had left and I would need to pick something else. I had been in the anthropology department as a work study and the advisor in there told me that ""anthropology is just like biology and anthropology can get you the same jobs as biology"". So I listened to her and I found out a year later that this was a lie and she only told me that because the department needed more students. She also started taking advantage of me and using me in other ways for her own academic goals which I won't go into but I did up reporting her for it, to which she was punished and removed as my anthro advisor. 

I get all A's and B's but still the professors and advisors treat me as if I am a failure. I have to stay an extra semester because a class that I was required to take was canceled so I was told to take it at a later semester. My scholarship won't cover another semester so I have to pay for that out of pocket, which I don't want to do. My high school didn't teach us anything after pre-algebra due to covid so when I got here I was told by an advisor that I am ""horrible at math"" and that I would be required to take a language, to where it was discovered that I have a cognitive issue which makes it very difficult to learn other languages. The German professors did not care for this, even though I was proving it to them by spending more time studying for their class than any other class and still getting D's in German while getting straight A's and B's in all my other classes. So I ended up having to go through the process of getting my doctor to fill out a form that says I formally can't learn another language just so I could get through college. 

I had a research position over the summer in biology in a hopeless attempt to get an in with the biology department. It ended up going poorly because of my lack of math and chemistry prerequisites. Then at the end my ""mentor"" for the project told me I was a lost cause with where I am at in academia and said I was too disruptive because I ""asked too many questions about the procedures and research"". This was frustrating because all the questions I was asking him related to ensuring I was doing something right or that I understood what we were doing correctly. 

There is so many more things I could talk about but I don't want to. I am at my senior year, I've talked to practically everyone at the university I can and they are no help with my situation. Apparently transferring at this point is ""unadvisable"" so I can't do that. What do I do? I genuinely don't know what to do at this point. I don't want to keep going here, I can't do it, I just can't. I just want to drop out. I never wanted to do this in the first place. This place is like one big nightmare that I've been living in for the past three years and I want it all to just end.

So my one goal in life is to move to the USA. I don't care what people have to say about how much they hate it, it's just the place for me. The nature, the freedom, the diversity, its perfect for my career. Please don't try and convince me it sucks because I wont listen. Visiting just wouldn't be the same. I want to have my life there, plus i cant afford the car rental to do the kind of things i want to do. 



Ive been accepted into an ecology phd in the UK. This is probably my best chance of getting to the USA because of the connections it will give me and its a subject relevant to the US. Would i have a reasonable chance at being sponsored for eb2 or something? 


Issue is i dont want to waste the rest of my 20s on it. Ill be 29 when I graduate. Theres other places i want to travel, things i want to do. Its not like a job where i can quit, travel for a bit, and come back. I can't defer it, cant take a year out, bc of the way its funded.


Ive looked into doing a phd in the US, but to do one as a UK national I'd need Fulbright funding or similar which means im not allowed to stay on after and have to go back for 2 years, and not eligible for a waiver because its partially UK funded. I cant find any degrees i want to do that are funded. And anyway, I'm not sure i could cope with how intense phds are over there.

I work as a **Technical Architect** for a large software company (everyones favorite CRM), and recently been contacted by one of my ex-bosses at some other company to join him, in a much smaller company (regional bank with about 2 billion net income). I've known the guy for many years, 10 plus years, and he reached because he wants me help with some tech transformation efforts.  

At my **current job** the pros: 

* High base salary + RSU + bonus
* unlimited PTO
* Fully remote.
* Very good Health Insurance ($100 a month PPO with very low deductible)

The cons:

* Close to zero opportunity for promotion in the next year or two
* very fast pace changing environment, had 9 managers in 2 years.
* The role I have is the one of a consultant, I do technical advising to our customers, Im part of the profesional services org, and my performance is measured on the amount of hours billed to customers on a yearly basis.

The opportunity Im being offered does not look good financially, pretty much they are offering

* Same Base pay, same bonus, and some RSU (they cant match what I get today)
* 21 days of accrued PTO per year
* 3 days in the office
* Somewhat good health insurance (\~$500 a month PPO, low deductible)

The only pro, I would be getting, is that I would be a Senior Manager at the company, reporting 1 level down the CIO, and would be given the technology transformation efforts that pertain to Artificial Intelligence ( I have a **M.Sc.** in AI), and thats it. So in short, a appealing title, and nice projects that align more closely with my degree.

I would like to hear some objective thoughts about this, because he is a friend and might getting in the way of making a decision cause I know him, and Im partial to liking work with him. ",2024-08-13 16:41:45,1,0,0,Positive,0.09078203639179248,0,0,2

1eifwcb,careeradvice,Interview in a remote resource town - how do i negotiate for risks of moving there?,"Hey all,

I am an accountant with an upcoming in-person interview in a resource town far north in BC, Canada. I like the company, I think it'll probably be a great move for me (always wanted to live in a small town because i generally hate the vancouver area), but there's a certain risk that can occur in these types of communities that won't occur elsewhere.

With these one-trick pony resource towns, generally the town is 1/3 - 1/2 employed by one company, that given market or other external conditions could pull up stakes at any particular time. The rest of the people generally work in services selling to the people who work in this 'company town' (i.e. there'll be an A&W or something)

The issue is, I have a home here in the Vancouver area, and if i sell it to buy a place up there, there's a risk that should said big resource company pull out, the property will be severely devalued because the town would half-die in the process.

Has anyone here negotiated for any sort of severance that contains any guarantee on the property value of a home or other risks related to moving? While renting is an option there, it's not an attractive option for sure. I would like to get out of this condo, but am likely going to rent for a few months anyhow to determine if i like the job before selling it.",2024-08-02 17:25:54,1,1,0,Positive,0.06406926406926407,0,0,2

So recently I have been looking at the progress I’ve made at my current company, and I’m not particularly happy about it. I feel that my personal and professional development hasn’t been what was promised and I’ve been looking for other opportunities.
 

Now there is a team in my company with whom I have a good relationship and do work that is very similar to what I do now. I’m interested in joining them and a few weeks ago I approached the LM of that team and asked if there is any possibility I could join (obviously this was a private affair). He said not at the moment due to budget limitations but possibly something in the coming year.
 

The problem is, I’m reaching a point in my current team where I’m either burnt out or unhappy or whatever. I don’t have regular 1 on 1s with my manager since he doesn’t believe in them, and the only time I can provide feedback is through a yearly meeting which has already passed. There is also a company-wide survey but I have bigger complaints about that.
 

I’m thinking of approaching him and saying that I want to look for other opportunities within the company, but I don’t know what else I can do since the team I want to join doesn’t have an opening.
 

I should add, this isn’t something new. I have mentioned this previously multiple times but he has ignored it or failed to acknowledge it. However, I'm giving the benefit of the doubt here that I wasn't clear enough.",2024-08-06 13:24:18,1,1,0,Negative,-0.02816558441558442,0,0,0

* **Previous Setbacks:** I had to drop out of my PhD program at Michigan Tech, resulting in a 1.5-year gap in my career which already had a gap of 2 years since my masters due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Given these challenges, I’m at a crossroads and seeking advice on the following:

1. **Career Path:** Should I consider transitioning to the industry where I might have better earning potential and possibly more structured support? If so, what types of roles or companies should I be looking at with my Nanopore sequencing experience?
2. **Job Search Timing:** When is the best time to start applying for new positions? Should I wait until the clinical trial actually begins or move on now?
3. **Leveraging Skills:** How can I best leverage my current skills and experiences, including my work with Nanopore sequencing, to make up for the career gap and lack of publications?
4. **Any Other Advice:** Any other advice or perspectives from those who have navigated similar transitions would be greatly appreciated.

1eh9fjb,careeradvice,I’m 25F and feel abandoned at my job.,"My managers chose a different captain instead of me. A (45M) bartender who started this year. No one likes him because he has an attitude and he’s sarcastic. If you ring in drinks and wait for them at the bar, he’ll purposely go slower. This was all without the title. Imagine now that he has it? Every one was appalled at the decision that it wasn’t me. Everyone predicted it was going to be me. I didn’t even want the position but it would’ve been nice to be offered the job. 

Truthfully, I was quiet about it and went about my day. But now I’m in bed realizing:

He, who has only worked on one building, never served on the floor, only bartended in the main building, started this March- got the job and I- who has started 4 years ago, who knows how to train staff on both buildings, knows the set up for four parts of the club, weddings and events floor plans, a-la-carte service, both of the building’s lunch service, side works for both buildings, course set ups for outings and tournaments, beverage cart set up and more- didn’t get the job.

I make $30/hr and he made $25/hr, before promotion.

I’ve reached the maximum pay and there’s really no more room for improvement for me. Nothing at all. I’ve reached the final boss at the game. I’ve beat every single level and finessed my craft to the point that both back and front of the house, even our members (people we work for) wholeheartedly believed I was going to be the one. 

I feel insulted, humiliated and honestly, abandoned. I didn’t even want the job in the first place. Yet, this hurt.

Does this come from my childhood? Feeling like I could be great at everything but I still wasn’t enough? 

I want to leave my job because there’s no more room for improvement. There are many old managers who have left that want me to work for them. The woman who hired me was fired because of new management. Her plan for me was to be captain that’s why she started me at $26/hr with a contract for a raise after 60 days. She gave me the raise after 31 days.

When she was fired; new management openly said during staff meetings that they were upset that I got paid so high, this was 2 years ago. 

 It really upset me. So much so that I can’t sleep. Do I just keep on going with this job or take a leap somewhere else where I can grow more?

I want to disclose this isn’t my career. I’ve graduated and am going back to school again next year (took a year off) for another degree and then finally going to get a big girl job. 

Am I taking this too seriously for no reason?

1emf0xq,careeradvice,Wanting to pivot from admin assistant to accounting related entry level job,"I am not super happy with my current, more secretarial admin job and would like to pivot towards accounts payable or receivable/accounting clerk type jobs. More numbers than people/words essentially haha.

For background info, I am an administrative assistant with an office administration certificate with a some job experience in accounts payable/receivable, and decent knowledge of accounting principles. I am ESL as well, if the grammar isn't great. I took a course in high-school on bookkeeping, took one semester of an bachelor's accounting degree 15 years ago and learned a decent amount of intermediate accounting and beginner SAGE in my office administration certificate course 5 years ago. I had a job for 3 years after the office admin certificate doing billing, time entry and problem solving unpaid purchase orders. I loved that job but the company had issues and I moved towns. 

I think I need/would like deeper knowledge on specific accounting principles like taxes and maybe payroll, and refreshers on stuff like bank reconciliation, the accounting cycle reports and SAGE. I know there are some cheap one-subject courses online but I dont know which ones are good. And I'm not sure if having the knowedge will be enough, I feel like I should have something to reflect that knowledge on my resume? I don't want to to back to school fulltime for a new certificate and I want to keep my current 9-5 for now to not get into more dept. I might get lucky be able to get an entry job but it's harder without the appropriate certificate on my resume. 

I'm not sure if i should take an official but expensive part-time/online certificate, or if I should take some online cheap refreshers courses only on specific subjects that I want to learn more but without the credentials. I really would rather not get into debt again. I'm torn. 

Is there a way to pull this off without getting into debt?",2024-08-07 15:38:24,1,0,0,Positive,0.21676136363636367,0,0,2
1enhy2g,college,I’m in a dilemma and I need help.,"Hello, everybody. I've fallen into a dilemma over my major and I need people's input, since my family couldn't care less.

I'm starting college soon, and I thought I was set on what I wanted and needed to do, which was marketing, but that changed last night. I was organizing myself and trying to learn different things that would put me ahead or make me stand out more. I was looking at YouTube videos, books, and online posts, and then I came across a post here on Reddit about how the marketing industry is not doing well at all. There's no demand, but a lot of supply, and it wasn’t guaranteed that I would get a job right out of college. After I saw that, I started looking more in-depth into it, and everything I found made it clear that if I want a good, stable income, I need to choose another career.

I've come from the worst of the worst, and that's a place I don’t want to fall back into, so I’m doing as much as possible to do things right. Thankfully, I've got 90% of my college tuition paid off, but the problem lies in my major. As much as I love marketing and digital creation, I’ve realized it might not be the right thing to do. I've started thinking about finance, and it’s something that interests me. The one thing holding me back is that I suck at math—like, really, really bad—and I’m guessing that major will involve a lot of math, or so it seems.

So this brings me to my point. Do I stick with marketing, work my ass off, and hope for the best, or do I change my major and trust myself to be able to pull through? Please give me all your advice I really need it.",2024-08-08 21:31:04,1,4,0,Positive,0.1207875457875458,0,0,2

1eoi5gs,careeradvice,Bullied into quitting,"I started a Machining job in 2022, Zero knowledge prior and 2 years later it's been trial and error, all of my trainers quit on me and I was thrown to the wolves. I adapted to the machining process, worked close with leadership and quality, putting in hundreds of hours of overtime. 

They rehired an employee who quit for a few months, a ""Lead"" if you will. They were placed on my shift. This employee had better opportunities and mentorship, leading to said employee getting the leg up on me for a Tech position. I've tried not being jealous but I can't shake this feeling of betrayal on my teams part. 

When I first started I made it my goal to be the best, I worked my ass off, made myself capable of running entire production lines on my own. Even training new operators on MANY other lines, I know just about every line in this shop. 

My leadership was fond of me, I pushed myself and filled in where needed... Now this employee has overshadowed my accomplishments, befriended my bosses and even made me the butt of the joke, criticizing me for some holes in my training, knowing I didn't have the same resources he did. 

I'm in a position where I feel betrayed, I went from Asset to disposable in a few short months. I'm seeking other employment opportunities currently, I don't know if I'm overreacting to someone being better than me, or if I'm getting bullied out of my position.

1elexza,careeradvice,Need help deciding between two paths to take,"**TLDR at the bottom**



I currently have a CS degree and I'm in my early thirties. The CS degree is from WGU. I got it earlier this year and it hasn't paid off so far. While I don't want to give up, the fact that layoffs seem to be bathing the white collar world in blood, make me less hopeful that I'll end up with a job in tech. While I'd love to have that SWE salary and WFH life, I'm trying to be realistic. I'm not fully giving up but I'm weighing my options.

It may be narrow viewed but I really only see two paths for myself going forward. Whether I get there in a straight line or not is debatable but I have two end goals. I'm deciding whether to be go for an accounting degree and a CPA, or go to nursing school and work towards becoming a CRNA. I'm in my early thirties. 

The CRNA path seems more interesting to me in general. I like science, I like exercise and sports and all that, the human body is interesting, etc. From reading about nursing in the their sub, I know how much it can suck.

For accounting, it seems like a way less hectic environment to start out in, and you still make decent money, but it is quite dry of material. I'm not great at excel at all but I'm sure I could learn. Anyone can learn.

The accounting path would likely be faster as I'd get my degree from WGU again, and work towards my CPA right after, and ideally have an internship. Nursing would take longer as I'd still need to become an RN and then work in ICU for 1-2 years and then CRNA school.

My goal is WLB and money, and maybe retiring early? I'm not sure about that yet. But I enjoy rock climbing a lot and I don't want my life to be all about work where I have to sacrifice my health and physical fitness for money. I mean I get there have to be sacrifices but you get what I'm saying.

Anyone have any advice on the subject from someone who is either a CPA for a while or a CRNA for a while? What do you like about your job? What do you dislike? How was the path to get to where you are now? What is your job search like? Do you feel financially stable and like you have job security?

  
**TLDR: Want WLB and Money. Job Security and Stability. Accounting to CPA or RN to CRNA.** 

**CPA = Certified Public Accountant** 

**RN = Registered Nurse**

**CRNA = Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist**",2024-08-06 11:08:22,2,0,0,Positive,0.11399659863945578,0,0,2

1esepzj,college,I feel like I wasted my summer  and it’s making me depressed ,"For the first time, I got a full-time summer internship. Though it wasn’t 100% aligned with my future career goals, I took the offer because  it was the only one I got that paid decently and was close enough to home. Now, however, I’m really depressed realizing that my summer is over and I never got to do anything.

At my job, I was the only intern at my particular office. So while interns at our main branch in a different state got to have socials and go to events together, I had nobody to do that with. All of my friends at home work different hours than me, so I had really limited time to see them too.

Although I know that this internship was a good decision, I can’t help but feel a little sad that it took up so much of my time. I was working 9-10 hour days with no social relief afterwards. The company didn’t make me feel like an intern, I felt like a full time employee. I’m still miserable thinking about it. 

I miss my friends. I miss the freedom of college life.

I was just wondering if anyone has any useful advice or websites/places to access after having graduated and looking for work

Whilst I do currently have a job, what it pays is not enough to sustain myself in the long run with paying for rent, bills, food etc

What websites did people find the most useful in gaining employment? I am mainly thinking about looking at charity based work or working in some capacity with youth/young people whether it be a school or some form of other organisation.

I think the thing that's worrying me a bit is when looking at job specifications I've realised that what they are looking for I am unable to fulfil.

Is there any valuable outlets people have used to gain experience in certain fields?

How did you find applying in the graduate market? Was it difficult or did you find something relatively easy? Websites covering graduate schemes would also be helpful 

I am also welcoming of applying for casual / part-time or temporary work in the meantime to cover me until I find something more substantial. Does anyone know of any websites as a catalogue of jobs that fit these requirements",2024-06-05 18:00:54,1,0,0,Positive,0.07595238095238095,0,0,2

1eqx3uc,college,Just feel like giving up sometimes.,"For context:

I'm a soon-to-be sophomore at a small no-name LAC school. I did terrible in HS, only managing to put together a 2.9 cumulative. 

Started to reflect upon myself and begin to reform my work ethic and attitude senior year, but by that point it was too late, so I just focused my attention to the future, and through it all I pulled off a 4.0 for the first two semesters of my college career.

Prior to that, tried to get into college extracurriculars, but commuter school means I kept being the only one to show up.

Then tried to apply to schools for transfer, but got rejected literally everywhere. (I was expecting it with that 2.9 in HS though tbh) 

After getting rejected everywhere, decided to dedicate my summer towards building a competitive app for my state flagship school's Statistics and Computer Science major (UIUC)

Took on 8 credits, managed to get an A in one but will probably get a B in the accelerated 7- week Calculus course i'm taking, despite studying damn near 40 hours on the second-to-last test. 

Said major I intend on applying for has a grade requirement of an A- or higher for all mathematics courses, so I'm pretty sure I just all but screwed up my chances, meaning all my work this summer will be in vain, and I just ruined my 4.0 for no reason.

I just feel lost, defeated. Like everything I do and all the work and effort I put in is for nothing. I could barely get out of bed today because there just feels like there's no point to my life anymore. 

Really, If I'm being honest, a big component to my own obsession with transferring is because I want to be recognized, to feel genuinely wanted in a meaningful and substantial way that isn't just unconditional, y'know? 

I don't know man, It just hurts to always face rejection sometimes.",2024-08-13 02:49:55,1,1,0,Positive,0.10833333333333332,0,0,2

So basically for some context. I work at a startup as a product manager. I joined a month and a half ago. I got approached by their direct competitor, offering a higher salary.

Heres the thing, i really dont like where im working at. Everybody is rude, they make horrible decisions, and the product is unfinished and flat out terrible. The competitor is established, very well known and flat out better.

Ive been working my ass off trying to help them. The entire board keeps making awful decisions that I have to babysit them not to do. They're inexperienced and unrealistic in their demands. They get rude when I stand up to them.

I cant leave however. My contract states:

Article 7: Illegal Competition of Work
During the two years following the termination of this contract the Second Party has no right to neither establish nor work in a competitive company running similar activities.

So I feel like im stuck. I could really use the money and the peace of mind by moving into the established company, but it seems like i cant do much. Theres someone who did the switch, but I believe she has a different contract. This is extremely demotivating and I want some advice on how to make the best out of this.

EDIT: Feel like i have to state that im not in the US, and my country's in the midst of a war, so dont know if courtrooms are even open if im getting sued. Also the article has a double negative which idk if i can abuse that lol

EDIT 2: Spoke to a lawyer, since im on probation that contract doesnt go into effect until afterwards. I still need advice on how to approach them concerning quitting since i want to be polite and not burn bridges",2024-08-10 09:10:36,1,2,0,Negative,-0.08498463901689705,0,0,0

In einer Welt, die zunehmend von Woke-Ideologie und Cancel Culture dominiert wird, scheint nichts mehr sicher zu sein. Der neueste Trend? Die Verdreifachung der Studiengebühren für ausländische Studierende an der ETH Zürich und Lausanne. Klingt das nach einem fairen Deal oder nur nach einer weiteren verrückten Idee, die Bildung in ein Luxusgut verwandeln soll?

Ab dem Herbstsemester 2025 sollen ausländische Studierende an den ETHs etwa 2200 Franken pro Semester bezahlen. Das ist eine satte Erhöhung gegenüber den bisherigen 730 Franken. Der ETH-Rat, der im März noch gegen eine Erhöhung war, hat nun überraschend umgeschwenkt. Was ist passiert? Ist es die drängende Notwendigkeit, Budgetkürzungen zu kompensieren, oder doch nur ein fauler Kompromiss, um ein Sparprogramm des Bundes zu rechtfertigen?

Die Gebühren in der Schweiz gehören zu den niedrigsten in Europa. Selbst bei einer Verdreifachung bleiben sie im Vergleich zu internationalen Spitzenuniversitäten moderat. Aber lassen wir uns nicht von dieser Schönfärberei blenden. Eine Verdopplung oder Verdreifachung der Gebühren belastet die internationalen Studierenden enorm und könnte die ETHs weniger attraktiv für Talente aus dem Ausland machen. Die Argumente der Hochschulen, dass es notwendig ist, um den Standard zu halten, sind zwar verständlich, aber wer profitiert am Ende wirklich davon?

#Woke-Ideologie und Cancel Culture: Überall und nirgendwo sinnvoll

Und jetzt zum Elefanten im Raum: Woke-Ideologie und Cancel Culture. Sie scheinen alles zu durchdringen, von der Bildungspolitik bis hin zu sozialen Debatten. Was bringen sie uns wirklich? Mehr Gerechtigkeit oder nur mehr Unsinn? Statt sich auf echte, greifbare Lösungen zu konzentrieren, drehen wir uns im Kreis um politische Korrektheit und hypersensibles Verhalten. 

Wie passt die Erhöhung der Gebühren hier rein? Nun, es könnte als Versuch gesehen werden, die Hochschulen ""elitären"" und ""exklusiven"" Kreisen zugänglich zu machen, anstatt echte Chancengleichheit zu fördern. Vielleicht sollten wir weniger darauf hören, was die Woke-Community sagt, und mehr auf das, was wirklich sinnvoll und fair ist.

Ist das die Zukunft der Bildung?

Vielleicht wäre es sinnvoller, die Auswahlkriterien für die Studierenden zu überdenken, anstatt einfach die Gebühren zu erhöhen. Bildung sollte für alle zugänglich sein – unabhängig von Einkommen oder Herkunft. Alles andere ist schlichtweg unethisch und falsch. Solange wir in diesem Woke-Wahnsinn feststecken, werden echte, pragmatische Lösungen jedoch wohl kaum Gehör finden.

I know they’ll definitely ask me what my salary expectations are. In my previous roles, the ranges have been pretty small and I pretty much knew what I could get based on my experience. 

This one is a little tougher. For example, my current salary is around $120k, and the job is offering a salary in the range of $100k-$150k. The minimum I’m willing to take to move is ~$130k. This new role actually has better vacation and WFH benefits so I don’t mind taking a small increase. 

I’m wondering however, should I aim even higher so as not to leave any money on the table? 

The thing is, $150k is kind of a lot for my role, and I don’t even know if the majority of companies that have this position would ever offer that. I’m almost at the top end of the salary band for this position in the industry as is. I don’t want to waste my opportunity by asking too much. Should I stick to the $130k number (still obtainable in the market) or push a little bit more?

They all go to each others' offices and say hello and literally PASS by my office NUMEROUS times a day to get to other offices and completely ignore the fact that Im there. They go to the office next to me and then go right back to their own offices. What really blows my mind is that my own manager doesnt talk to me during the day. This entire WEEK, ive probably spoken/seen her once for like 10 minutes and it was because she needed something. My manager literally SKIPS my 1-1 meetings but goes to everyone elses. I keep thinking if they dont need me, why not just get rid of me and save money? I am doing a LOT of work for them though so maybe they want me to keep doing that for the horrible pay im getting. I get thrown under the bus and never get recognition for anything I do. Anytime theres something wrong, the blame is on me. Yesterday, everyone left 2 hours early and no one said bye so when I went to the washroom I noticed everyones door was closed and lights were off. I was dumfounded.

My manager went on vacation a week ago and i was the last to know and that was only because i tried calling her and she told me she wont be in for a week. Shes going on another vacation and I found today from someone else. Shes leaving when we have a project that is starting so it's going to be all on me and if something goes wrong, it's my fault.

So I'm about to finish a degree in Bio, and my parents is saying for me to become a medical doctor so people will treate nicely and respected

I've taken all the classes needed except for advanced phys (I've only taken Intro to A and P), and a psychology course. I've taken all the bios, cell, biochem I and II, AP chem (this was a long time ago, during COVID), organic I and II (this was also taken 3 yrs ago).

I wanna complete school and my degree in Biotech as fast as possible, I only have 1 class to take before I grad this fall, and I hope to either go into the industry with something microbio related or grad school for a masters.

What options do I have, would it be best to look for a job in the industry for Biotech or should I get a masters or should I entertain taking the mcat or uprooting everything and all my hard work towards my biotech degree (which again I graduate this winter) and go into medicine (which wasn't off the table but not my priority) ?

Choosing what to apply to versus what is likely a waste of time is a bit challenging, so I'm curious how closely the advertised postdoc work should match my PhD work so that I am a competitive applicant?

My PhD research is in coastal geomorphology (i.e. repeatedly mapping coastal landscapes > analyzing the data empirically and integrating with models > to study landscape evolution). I see many postdoc opportunities that are essentially this topic and suggest a very similar approach, but applied to non-coastal environments such as rivers and hill-slopes. So, basically same approach, but different setting. I think I'm well-qualified for these positions, though I've almost exclusively conducted research in coastal settings. What do you think?

Then, of course there's the converse, similar setting, but different approach or type of question. This one is maybe harder to define, but something like a similar coastal setting, but rather than approaching a geomorphic question from repeat mapping I'd use stratigraphy instead. Or maybe I'm using similar repeat mapping techniques to answer a more ecological question versus geomorphic. I think this one is a bit harder to answer concretely, though I still think I'm decently qualified for many of these positions. What do you think?

My current role I am just under 2 years, the company has great benefits, 10% bonus (almost guaranteed), fully remote and a pension I'll be fully vested after 3 years of employment. 

I stay active on LinkedIn due to having been through reduction in force layoffs in the past.  My industry is always changing, due to trends in the market and of course advancements in technology.  I have been talking with a recruiter and she wants me to interview for a job with a company that has almost exactly the same benefits and again lateral move and about 10% increase.  I would walk away  from my pension at current role which only is about $10k in there now (would lose it all because not vested), and my year end bonus.  There literally is nothing wrong with my current job, I'm acclimated, like the people and fully remote is great. However, I anticipate a future shake up which would prob be announced Sept or Oct.   I know there is no harm interviewing. My question is how do I say to the recruiter that I want to continue with interview but not sure the overall compensation would be worth me to voluntarily move?  I also feel like constantly moving ever 1-2 years for lateral moves takes me about 6 months just to acclimate to new systems, workflows and people even though the job is exactly the same. This 6month onboarding is slowing down the trajectory of my career.  If I knew my job now was 100% safe I would not bother interviewing anywhere else.  

Can I or should I just follow it through with interview just in case I am correct about my current role being in jeopardy?  I don't want to waste anyone's time but also want to be in their pipeline for the near future incase I'm forced to job hunt soon.

Any thoughts and or advice would be helpful. The recruiter is from outside the company so I know I can be honest with her.

1eliqrq,careeradvice,Client expectations do not align with my company. How can I navigate this mess?,"I made a previous post how my company basically misled me to hire me and I’m kind of stuck until I find a new job. Long story short, the expectation was a remote job assisting a client and assisting my company when needed. Reality is the client sees me as a contractor that is dedicating 100% of my time to them on a hybrid schedule. The whole thing is a shit show and I’d quit if I could have another job lined up. With the job market as it is, the only thing I can do is keep applying and tread water.

Other than having to commute 90 minutes 3 days a week, the biggest issue right now is my clients expectations and my companies. My company has been hammering me with deliverables and meetings that you would expect from a consultant. However, my client is very unhappy that I’m dedicating working hours to the consulting company. They see me as a contractor and that is how the contract between my company and them was set up. My paperwork even calls me a contractor, states the hybrid schedule, and says I need to dedicate 40 hours a week to them. I did not have access to this paperwork until I started with the client.

I’ve talked to both sides and both don’t want to budge. The client is pissed that I have other responsibilities outside of them and that was not what was sold to them. My company is pissed I am having trouble meeting deliverables. For example, at 1pm last week I got an email saying they needed a PowerPoint completed by end of day (5pm). The client is giving me daily responsibility that takes me a full work day to complete and also needs to be done by 5pm. I prioritize the client, then get scolded for not meeting deadline for the PowerPoint. 

I fucking hate this job and want to quit so bad. Clearly the client and my company do not have the same vision for me and I don’t know what to do. Do I go to the clients management and explain the situation? Do I go to my companies HR and grill them for the awful management of my employment? I feel like either could get me fired.",2024-08-06 14:08:28,3,1,0,Negative,-0.10598354978354978,0,0,0

If I took online classes I could leave at the beginning of December and return right before the spring semester starts in January (would take in-person classes in the spring) and finish my classes in my girlfriend's country (she finishes her classes around the same time as me). If I took in-person classes I would be able to leave on December 19 at the earliest but it's way cheaper to leave at the beginning of December.

I might like online classes because my commute is half an hour each way but I might hate them. It would be worth it if we're still together by then (I think we will be) but if we break up then I would feel silly for taking not taking in-person classes.

In the end, I decided to use the traditional format for one poster and stick with the BetterPoster style for the other (I only have time to change the style for one of the posters, so I changed the one that I deem more important for me. I’m also really tired.).

I printed them today and can confidently say that the issue with the BetterPoster isn’t the font size—the text is readable from ten feet away (though the pictures may not do it justice). The real problem, as many have pointed out, is that the BetterPoster format doesn’t allow for as much information as a traditional poster.

1dfzvar,academia,How do I politely decline a PhD offer?,"Sorry in advance about the length.

About 6 months ago I was approached by a PI at my workplace about applying for PhD funding with her. At the time it seemed like an amazing opportunity and I was incredibly flattered to have been approached. I was mixed about the idea of pursing a PhD but the grant is one of the most competitve in the country and the PI and I both agreed it would be a long shot, so I figured what the hell it can't hurt.

To everyone's surprise, I've recently been shortlisted for interview.

The problem is...PhD stipends in my country are incredibly low, too low to live off of. Since applying for this grant, I've received interest from recruiters about jobs that would pay double my current salary and I'm currently waiting to hear back about an application for my dream job. Anyway, after months of thinking, I've decided a PhD is not something I want. If I was offered this grant I would turn it down.

However...this PI has put so much work into helping me with this application and prepping me for my interview and specifically did not approach anyone else to apply with. The grant would be in my name so if I turned it down, she would lose out. While I don't work with this PI in my current job, she works in the same building and I share an office with members of her lab so I need to be as diplomatic as possible about this.

I've been informed that I'll know within 24 hours of my interview if they want to offer me this grant. 

In the event that I'm offered this grant, how do I diplomatically say that ""while I did do my interview yesterday, I do not want this."" How do I break it to my PI after all the work she's put into this?

tl;dr I have the opportunity to be awarded a hugely competitive grant for a PhD however since applying 6 months ago, I've decided it's not for me. If I'm offered this grant, how do I turn it down and let my PI know after she painstakingly helped me apply?",2024-06-14 20:03:13,21,8,0,Positive,0.07816804407713497,0,0,2

I completed my MSc with a final grade of 7.2/10 and even taught 1st-year students financial accounting. But after job hunting in this field, I’ve realized it’s not for me and I'm eager for a career change.

I’ve recently discovered a passion for Biology, especially Mycology. I took a class with Mycelia Academy in Belgium and plan to finish their advanced mycelium production course. This is not just for personal interest but also to show universities my dedication and proactive approach.

Here are my questions:

1. **University Programs**: Do you think my profile is appealing to universities? Specifically, would I be eligible for an undergraduate program in Biology in the EU?
2. **English-Taught BSc Programs**: Does anyone know of universities in the EU that offer BSc Biology programs in English? It seems these are quite rare compared to economics programs.
3. **Path to Mycology**: I’ve searched for BSc programs in Mycology but found none. Can anyone with Mycology experience share their academic or professional journey?
4. **Bridging Programs**: Are there any bridging programs that could shorten the time needed to go from a BSc to an MSc? I’m looking at a 4-5 year commitment and any advice on this would be great.

Thanks so much for your time and any help you can provide!",2024-06-14 17:54:48,1,4,0,Positive,0.18214285714285716,0,0,2
1dhxxvj,academia,How to become a good researcher ?  ,"

Hello, 

I’m a masters student in humanities and I don’t see myself doing anything else than research in academia. However I feel that I’ve never been trained to think independently and, although I’ve always been a top student, I’m starting to realise that good students don’t necessarily make good researchers. 

I still believe that with work and motivation I can do it, but I would like to know what makes a good researcher (in humanities), and what I should do, or what books to read to be able to become a good researcher ?

Thanks ! ",2024-06-17 13:22:14,13,10,0,Positive,0.4318181818181818,0,0,2
1e748de,academia,Just got threatened by my supervisor for 8 years on leaving postdoc for Industry ,"Hi everyone 

I used to read about such horror stories on forums and I never thought it'll happen to me.

I did my PhD for 5.5 years under this Prof as a joint student. Then I did 2.5 years of postdoc. 

I didn't really see any future in Academia for myself. Totally not subjecting my family the horror of a postdoc treadmill. Today I had a chat with my supervisor about leaving for an industry job offer I have. 

After forcing me to take annual leave during my notice period so that he doesn't have to pay me out, he wants me to work on some unfinished manuscripts during that period. Otherwise, he said very clearly, I'll be burning the bridges, pissing him off, abandoning any possible entry back into academia, and won't get recommendations that get me jobs. He essentially joked about how one PhD guy stood him up and then struggled to get a job.

I'm absolutely crushed. I really looked up to him. He has issues, but I never thought he'll be so petty. After 8 years of a good professional relationship, this is what I am to him.

And the worst thing is, I will do as he says. I won't piss him off.

Absolutely gutted.

For how long will they prey on vulnerable postdocs with nowhere to go? My 2.5 years have been absolutely horrible. If it weren't for putting my family at risk, I would've resigned and driven Uber. I fantasized about it for long. The system is rigged and we have nowhere to go.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the kind words of encouragement. I have decided that I'm not going to work on my leave. All my postdoc work, which includes a lot of papers and industrial consultancy work, is nicely tied up. This is him just being greedy. Whatever he wants to do, it's upto him. Unpaid work is illegal and I am not going to do it. He's a unionist BTW. Also this is a QS top 50 university.",2024-07-19 13:50:38,156,46,0,Positive,0.0252,0,0,2

1db3cyb,university,A little help!,"
So basicallyyy im planning to go into optometry in the future however I was dropped to science foundation last minute, and couldn’t switch back and you need a Grade 6 in science to go into Biology a-level so i had to scrap my initial choices of Biology, Psychology and Creative Media A-Levels, and think of another route, i went to an interview at a college yesterday and they really helped me come to a conclusion, she told me i could either go into

1) T-Level Health Sciences (Manchester uni accepts it) or i could either do

2) three a-levels of my choice including psychology (you only need grade 5’s in science and maths) then do a “foundation year” in uni or something but i dont really understand that yet so can yall help me and explain it pleasee? 😭💖 but i decided i’d do Psychology, Creative media and EITHER: English language, Lit (idk which one is easier & im naturally good at both) Sociology or Business studies (im naturally good at Business too) but i need help choosing one, thats why im asking here on the forum. 
Also if you’re wondering why Creative media, it’s because i have a passion for editing and digital graphics i make professional edits and stuff in my free time using adobe software and i love it so much, also im a creative person so I wanted to keep that as maybe for a side hustle in the future alongside my Optometry career. But i really wanna know which option i should take, please help me out! 

I’m more inclined towards the A-level route because it’s more traditional, and flexible and if i feel like if I dont feel like going into it in the future, i can take another route and broaden my horizons (go into psychology, english whatever instead at university) because im not fully sure about optometry yet but it’s my dream job at the moment

The T-Level route seems simple and easy to follow, however the problem is at the college that i want to go to, and many other colleges, they only allow you to do one T-Level and that’s it and you can only go into one thing like Optometry with it and i want to have a wide choice.

What do you guys think! Please help me out id appreciate it so much! And good luck on yall’s exams 💖",2024-06-08 13:47:51,1,0,0,Positive,0.2202421171171171,0,0,2

1cpjdwp,academia,Choosing between two TT offers,"Hey folks, I’m currently a postdoc working in a STEM field, and in the exciting position of having to choose between two TT offers from great (top 75) R1 universities in the US. I think I’d be pretty happy at either, but it’s a really complicated decision and I’d love to hear people’s thoughts. Option A is a large public university and option B is a smaller private university. Here’s my breakdown:

Research fit: Both places have lots of research resources, but option A has much better facilities for some of the work I’d like to do, and more opportunities for collaboration. I was also able to negotiate a nice joint appointment at option A which would allow me to recruit from a broader pool of students.

Department fit: Have had very positive interactions with both departments. Option A had a bunch of mid-career people leave recently, I don’t want to speculate on that too much but still noteworthy. Option B has had a bunch of new faculty hires recently so there’s a really exciting young faculty cohort, and plans for more growth in the future. The lab space at option B is a bit dreary (no windows and needs extensive renovation), but it’s better situated for interactions with colleagues than option A. Both places have great support for pre-tenure faculty and very high tenure rates.

Salary / benefits: Very similar salary and benefits offered from both places. Option B is offering quite a bit more startup funding, with fewer restrictions on how it’s spent. I’m not sure how much to weigh this since I’d be expected to get grant funding pretty quickly at either place.

Teaching: Both places have very reasonable teaching loads. Option B is probably a better fit in terms of what courses I’d be teaching, but we haven’t fully nailed that down yet. Option B is much more selective at the undergrad level and will have smaller classes with better quality students.

Personal fit: Option B is in a much nicer city that’s also better geographically situated (closer to partner, family, and friends), but A isn’t that much farther away. Both places are pretty affordable to live in, though B is slightly more expensive.

My wife and I meet a year and a half ago. She (29f) graduated with her undergrade in Media and communication in 2019. She had good leads and was excited about her prospects, but when Covid hit it killed her chance to grab the kind of job she wanted. She had planned to get her masters, but due to COVID and her family moving she did not. Her family moved from Jersey to NC. Since then she has not has success finding work in her career.

She does photography on a side. She has shot many live shows, but that slowed down as we went into wedding planning mode. Before she meet me she did get a entry level job doing photography and edits for their magazine I think. It was not a good fit and she got fired after a couple of months. She doesnt like talking about it.

She has a history of ramping up applications, trying to get out there, and then getting rejection after rejection. It crushes her to the point she has very bad depression connected to her career. She blames people for not giving her the chance.

She has been working at a grocery store every since college. It is one of the nicer ones and she does a lot and gets paid well for the job. But it is not what she wants and forces her to work weekends.

I do not know every detail and I am not going to judge where my wife is at. but the truth is that while she can get interviews, she never gets the job. It is like having a dream crushed and she now struggles with motivation to try.

First, I feel for her. I wish it was easier. However, I am in IT which has much for work and my understanding is that media/communication is a much harder field to get a decent entry level paying job in.

If she has years of hardly any work in her field, and no continued education to stand on, I fear she is not going to get the job she wants. I dont know what she needs to do though. She believes she has the skills needed, but that no one will hire her over lack of experience working in the field and the long stretch since her degree

She is looking at media/marketing jobs. I dont know enough about this field to have much input, but I do know that probably needs something to help her. She is to the point where she feels is pointless try, but doesnt know what to do. If she does nothing and applies to jobs, nothing about her situation is going to change.

If she had been able to grab an internship after her undergrad she would have been in a better spot id think.

Imo her only options is to get the masters+internship or get a media cert or something and work extremely hard to work on a portfolio.

1cxvu5j,university,dissertation mistake,"can i still get a 2:1 in my dissertation if they rest of it is very well written but i made an error of inclusion in the results section?

one of my research questions was on the difference in MLU between children with ASD and their Typically developing peers.

I wrote up the preliminary analysis and the descriptive stats (mean and standard deviations) appropriately but for the independent t test measuring the significance in the group difference i wrote: 

An independent samples t-test revealed a significantly lower MLU in the ASD group 
than the TD group (t(30) = -1.812). This was further supported by a Cohen’s d effect 
size of -0.64 which indicates a moderate to large effect size, as well as practical 
significance of the results. 



is this a major error??? even though i said the difference was not significant i forgot to include the p value to show that!!!!
how bad is this?

I didn’t have the right resources, had a hard time at home, worked super often almost 40+ hours a week, and was just overall immature with the way that I saw myself in college/didnt see myself ever going back since it was kind of pushed on me. So overall I had a really hard time doing averagely, so forget doing well. I also recently got diagnosed with ADHD so that might have been part of my struggling haha. 

I recently have been thinking about going back to get a degree and just overall move up and continue my studies. 
Mostly because Im having a hard time finding a job I like because of the job market, partially because it feels like Im meant to do more with my life. 
I always knew that pursuing a graduate degree would be really difficult because of my low GPA in undergrad (2.73) so now I’m looking for other options. 
Im in NY and double majored in Psych/Sociology and would ultimately hope to get a phD in clinical psychology or MD in psychiatry(which is a bit of a longshot and really I’m leading towards the earlier option). I would really love to be a school psychologist or work with kids or be a professor someday. 
I dont have financial support so Im a little strapped for cash but will most likely suck it up and take out students loans like everyone else. 
I was thinking about getting a post bacc as a boost before a Masters especially since Im 98% sure I dont have the grades nor much experience in this field after graduating in 2021 to get into school. The only option for a post bacc program near me is Columbia and idk if thats an option financially/academically. Do I get another bachelors? Do I try to reach out and apply to all of the public university graduate programs near me with my 2.7 gpa and hope for the best? Give up lol?

One peer of mine said that they sometimes have to email a professor 3 times a day for a week to get a response and that’s as their research assistant. As TA I’ve learned that they rarely look at written submissions and that’s why my feedback always seemed shallow and uninspiring. Students are referred to by one professor as “the enemy.”

It just made me sad. I think had a child’s perspective of how intelligent and influential they were. Now I can’t see myself working with them beyond undergrad stuff. I don’t know. I think I just wanted to say that I’m very disappointed and my view of academia has changed recently. I used to think people were just being sensitive and butt-hurt about normal workplace stuff. How wrong I was… this is genuinely unpleasant. I love researching and writing. I’m traveling with professors and presenting alongside them. Some don’t even do two weeks worth of research before presenting a “paper” or “potential research topic.” The worst is how they blow so much smoke and jerk me off…

1epx59c,careeradvice,I’m frustrated and angry with myself. ,"I graduated with a BS in psych and have been floundering ever since. I LOVED my school while I studied and worked there as a resident advisor. Upon graduation I had to move back home suddenly to take care of family matters and it feels like I’ve been in survival mode ever since. I also got stuck in my shitty ass town and couldn’t move back to the metroplex because I ended up having to raise a sibling. 

I have since worked at multiple jobs, starting with child protective services, then moving to a different sector in the child welfare field. I wasn’t bad at the positions by any means, but I found myself unhappy all the time and working crazy hours. So I left after three years combined. 

I decided to go into the mental health field then. Went to work at my local inpatient psychiatric hospital and loved my patients, but hated the toxicity of the place. So I went into case management. I ended up despising my workplace because I was also forced to do crisis work after hours on a rotation and case management at the same time. At this point my sibling graduated high school in May of this year. So I moved in June back to the metroplex. 

I now work in case management in a more leadership role. And I do like it more than my previous positions, but…. I still hate case management. I have been trying to get my masters in counseling, but I just feel so unmotivated and honestly, burnt the hell out. 

I’m finally in a place in my personal life where I have a great support system and I REALLY want to try to work for a university (it would be amazing if I was able to go back to my alma mater but I’m not hopeful) in a more supportive administrative role. 

Has anyone done something similar? Or gained essentially their entire working career in one field only to completely flip flop around? I just feel really discouraged and frustrated with myself that I can’t hack it basically. I feel like there have been signs that I wasn’t meant to be in this field and I’ve just ignored them, which makes me feel like I’ve ruined my chances. 

tldr; I feel trapped working in the mental health field and want to try to work at a university in an admin role. But I feel like I waited too long to start the change. ",2024-08-11 22:17:56,1,8,0,Positive,0.003185185185185191,0,0,2

My plan is to transfer to a state university for a BS in CS after completing my associate's. I still need 17 more credits to graduate with my AS.

i’m a bit stuck on what i should do.
currently i have decided to do my bachelors online as i don’t have that much money to go abroad (and education here isn’t as valued + is expensive just for being where it is)
im stuck between psychology and social work, i have really been interested in in social work these past few months but have heard a lot of negative things about it, i also really like psychology but im scared of not being able to find a job without furthering my studies after graduation.

im not from the states, canada, europe, etc. so there isn’t any support in terms of cheaper education and i just want to make sure im not making a mistake with my choice online.

eventually i do want to get a masters, and i truly would like to become a therapist abroad afterwards if possible so i was leaning towards psychology but it seems like i could also be a counsellor with social work but im not entirely sure.
i also saw an online associate for beginning nursing but im not sure how well that will work out considering the different regulations and how most certifications and examinations are regional, i wouldn’t want to do 2 years and find out i can’t become an RN, LPN, etc. because i’m unable to do the exam abroad or something similar to that.

i hope someone who has become a therapist or counsellor in either us, canada, or any english-speaking country in europe could let me know their process and what they studied, i would be extremely grateful for any advice.

Im planning on studying marketing or maybe even change to international business or system engineering. This because I feel like these are very versatile careers and the knowledge I get will be useful for basically any aspect I decide to work in. I want to pursue acting but I also need a secure path while I do it. Since acting has a lot to do with networking I believe marketing or business will be good. Also Ive had many experiences with business, selling, marketing products and digital design. I like design too. 

I got into:

*Fordham University, Lincoln Center + scholarship 25k minimum per yr. Major: New Media and Digital Design

*Bentley University +scholarship of 28k per yr. Major: Marketing

Suffolk University + scholarship 23k per year only covering courses that are required to graduate. Major Marketing (i think??)

Bard College + like 80% coverage of all fees/tuition major: dont remember rn

I hate my job with a passion.

I absolutely hate everything about my job that I’ve been at for around 11 months. I’ve wanted to leave since my second week in but held it together because of the risk of not finding one in this economy. I’ve experienced everything from torturous levels of micromanagement to various levels of disrespect and manipulation to sexual harassment. I did raise the flag multiple times and some of these issues were resolved, but experiencing all of these in such a short period of time has made me irreversibly unhappy at the company, in addition to the fact that after abusing my motivation and energy, I’m currently cast aside as I’m no longer the shiny new toy to drive raw. I’m objectively very good at what I do and every year I’ve taken more responsibility and learnt new skills and challenged myself and I’m a good leader, people never want to leave my team because they are confident in the direction I give and I’m fair and respectful.

I’ve recently gotten an offer for an IC level role at a bigger company that interests me more. As I’m currently a Senior Manager and have been for a couple of years, this would hinder the quick and steep career progression on my CV. But I feel I need to leave this job to be happy.

18nwkay,students,"Teacher Doesn't Grade Papers, Wins Award","I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit for this, but I figured I'd give it a shot.

For context, I am a high school Junior. Last year, I took an honors literature course, and the course was absolute hell. Every honors course I had taken before, regardless of subject, had not even been close to this degree of severity, and I essentially learned nothing. However, this isn't about my struggles with the curriculum, and rather the teacher. When scheduling courses for this year at the end of last, I had found through word of mouth that this teacher (I'll call her Beth for the purpose of this story) had been shifted to teach the honors and regular English course for the Junior year. In a deliberate attempt to avoid having that god forsaken teacher again, I had opted to take the AP course with a different teacher. Best decision of my life.

As to why Beth is a horrible teacher, she has openly admitted to not grading any of our essays or projects. Instead, she just randomly takes away a few points that she cannot explain other than ""this wasn't very strong."" Because of this, one of my peers risked their grade to test if Beth had actually been grading the papers. She wrote about ducks and absolute garbage, other than a few sentences at the beginning and end. Beth deducted two points out of 60, whereas I wrote an essay that was focused on the prompt, and received a 53/60. I even went as much as to ask her why received the grade i did, and she just claimed that there were some small errors and weak claims.

To make all of this even worse, she has won the state award for best teacher of the Year award twice in the last 3 years, and this year earning second place. She is actively receiving awards for being the complete opposite of a great teacher. Infact, all that Beth had us do our sophomore year is film videos with her to make herself look good. In the videos, we would be doing projects that we could ""do for the rest of the week"" or ""continue the next day"" when in reality she would just throw them all away after recording and have us write an essay the next day instead. Beth would have us write essays and submit them to contests, but first she has to ""check them"" where she completely flips the entire thing upside-down and rewrite it herself, and if any one she wouldn't even credit us, instead just writing us as ""one of her students."" We were never accredited to writing these essays, and she would overwork us just to make it look like it is all her teaching us to make us brilliant. Plus, whenever we read anything, it is always Shakespearean, because she loves to brag about how her students are great at Shakespeare and could tell anyone all about it. She is using her students for her own personal growth.

The school administration won't do anything about this because, well, she seems to be an absolutely great teacher. So many awards and she teaches her students so well.

If anyone has any advice as to what I should do, please tell me. I'm completely clueless as to what to do here, and I'd like to help my peers who do have her class this year. Her class is an absolute hell and the things she has done needs to be brought to light.

1en7g2a,careeradvice,Should I be bracing for termination?,"Due to Tropical Storm Debby, 4/5 people on my team were deployed to different parts of the state to get footage of people working to keep the roads safe and passable. I was the only one told to stay back in the office with our supervisor and to basically sit at the computer and help “support” the staff members that are deployed.

I’ve been at this job for a year this month, but I feel like I’ve seen little growth. This job requires a lot of “get up and go” and requires us to work with different people across the state. Those four people who got deployed, including someone who just started but has the same role as me, have been given the golden opportunity to show what they are capable of. Meanwhile, I’ve been dismissed and kept out of different conversations. I’m apart of a group chat where everyone is sharing photos and engaging with supervisors, and I really feel left out. 

I’m starting to get the feeling that the exclusion is the most covert way of them saying that I am not needed nor am I at all a valuable asset to the team. I’m thinking that right as my probationary period is up, they are going to let me go. This has been my first ever full time job that I got as soon as I graduated from college. It feels that no matter what I do or despite any good days I may have, I am generally not well respected and not thought of as reliable or smart enough compared to my colleagues.

I thought I would be able to lie to myself enough and push through, but I can’t.

I am so unhappy and uncomfortable with the position I have put myself in and now I am so lost. I do not know what to do. I have worked an internship in the industry and it only further pushed me away from working in the field.

I asked around and a shift lead took them down because they needed to be in a frame. So i painted a rainbow frame and put my pictures back up. Every time i come in I have to search for where the pictures are put even when I make sure they couldnt possible be in the way. My manager sides with me but the people who have worked there 10+ years are the issue. My manager sent out an email to state that people are not to toch other peoples items but dont know what that will do.
I sent an email the the Diversity and Inclusion depatment and I know they contacted my boss's boss but no email response. I know a domino effect has begun.

1dvn3ef,academia,My university is accusing me of using AI. Their “expert” compared my essay with CHAT GPT’s output and claims “nearly all my ideas come from Chat GPT”,"In the informal hearing (where you meet with a university’s student affairs officer, and they explain the allegations and give you an opportunity to present your side of the story), I stated my position, which was that I did not use AI and shared supporting documentation to demonstrate that I wrote it. The professor was not convinced and wanted an “AI expert” from the university to review my paper. By the way, the professor made the report because Turnitin found that my paper was allegedly 30% generated by AI. However, the “expert” found it was 100% generated. The expert determined this by comparing my paper with ChatGPT’s output using the same essay prompt. 

I feel violated because it’s likely they engineered the prompt to make GPT’s text match my paper. The technique they’re using is unfair and flawed because AI is designed to generate different outputs with each given prompt; otherwise, what would be the point of this technology? I tested their “technique” and found that it generated different outputs every time without matching mine.

I still denied that I used AI, and they set up a formal hearing where an “impartial” board will determine the preponderance of the evidence (there’s more evidence than not that the student committed the violation). I just can’t wrap my head around the fact that the university believes they have enough evidence to prove I committed a violation. I provided handwritten notes backed up on Google Drive before the essay's due date, every quote is properly cited, and I provided a video recording of me typing the entire essay. My school is known for punishing students who allegedly use AI, and they made it clear they will not accept Google Docs as proof that you wrote it. Crazy, don’t you think? That’s why I record every single essay I write. Anyway, like I mentioned, they decided not to resolve the allegation informally and opted for a formal hearing.

Could you please share tips to defend my case or any evidence/studies I can use? Specifically, I need a strong argument to demonstrate that comparing ChatGPT’s output with someone’s essay does not prove they used AI. Are there any technical terms/studies I can use?

Due to some issues with loans, I had to drop down to half time therefore losing all my scholarships for this semester. I was expecting to owe a couple hundred left over from loans, but one of my scholarships went through and I am now seeing I will get an $8,000 refund. This seemed wildly inaccurate, so I gave the financial aid office a call and was pretty much told ""It looks like you should get the scholarship on my end but when I look at another source it says you won't. So you should get it but also expect to possibly give the money back."" I'm genuinely so confused because that gave me no clarity and I want to be able to set up a payment plan in time to cover additional costs if I need to.

But I have no idea what to do next! I didn’t take a gap year and would love to travel, but I have no money. I don’t want to get a proper career grad job because I want to travel. But I’m also dreading the idea of moving back in with my parents at the end of the month and working in my hometown where I have no friends because they all moved away! 

So basically I am looking for advice on what to do - cheap ways to travel and to meet people while travelling (I have looked at TEFL, I might do camp america next summer, but I would love to hear more options). Also more exciting ways to earn money and to have a better life and stay sane while moving home (I will try out different hobby clubs but I’m not feeling too excited about it). 

I don’t have a summer (or just job) job yet so any advice on that would also be great - thought maybe casual/ zero hours so I can go work festivals and go on holiday and stuff while still maximising my shifts…? And maybe online stuff like tutoring and selling my old stuff? In an ideal world I’d do something nature based like running forest school stuff or something like that but I don’t know how common that is.

1el3n0u,careeradvice,What do I do?,"I am 23 years old, I graduated in Dec of 2022 with my Bachelor’s Degree in Communications. I’m 1 short year away of getting my Graduate Degree in Professional Communications. Throughout all of this I’ve only been able to snag sales jobs. I can’t get a public relations and or media like job to save myself. I can’t even get a simple customer service rep position making more than $16hr. 

I have 11 months as an management trainee Intern at Enterprise 

I have 1 year of tour guide experience with S.C Johnson 


I have 15months of Residential Project Manger( outside sales representative with more responsibilities) experience at a heating and cooling company.

I was a college track athlete and maintained a good gpa and worked part time jobs the throughout my entire time in college. 

I can’t get customer service jobs above $16hr 
I made it to the last round of a staffing recruiter position but the entire department is white females so I ended up losing that position to a white female. Then the same company offered me a financial advisor position I have to pay for which is $2k for training then 100% commission with me finding my own leads. Which I told this company 2 years ago when I graduated that I’m independent with a lot of bills and responsibilities and that position just won’t work. 

I’m now at a car dealership no one is training me the hours are shit and I have no product knowledge and or training on the systems used to work with customer as well as no sales experience with cars. They keep just saying to “sell a car to this customer”. Been here a week and just now got a time clock. Still haven’t gotten my computer training on the vehicles I’m supposed to sell.

I’m in the process of trying to commission as an officer in the army/marines. Only problem is they need specific scores on the ASVAB test. I haven’t taken algebra since 10th grade and I’ve always been slower learner when it comes to math. The quicker option is just enlisting and getting a solidified job. Cons are taking very much lower pay and throwing my 6years of school and hard work down the drain. 

Pros are: my significant other and I can get housing with benefits that the military offers. As well as having a solidified position that would provide experience that maybe in 4 years could actually help me get taken serious. 


Sorry this is a long rant. I feel so stuck. It’s just that I feel like I did everything right and still lost. Every successful person I’ve ever met just “knew someone” and got connected. Even doing outside sales I met people making 150+ doing very easy jobs but the question is how did they get the job??

I’m a people person so sales comes natural. Doesn’t change the fact I hate it. Hours are so terrible you are always on edge because you are earning commission and it’s always unsteady. I just want a secure job. Not looking to even looking to make an insane amount. Entry level 55-60k is acceptable for me. ",2024-08-06 00:15:21,3,0,0,Positive,0.023445479641131813,0,0,2

I need your expert advice on a big decision regarding my career path!

I recently graduated from Northeastern University with a BS in Computer Science and Business Administration. Currently, I'm working as a Project Head at a startup called Edysor. By Fall 2025, I’ll have about one year of full-time work experience.

Here's a snapshot of my internships:

* **KKR & Co. L.P.:** Developed AWS Sagemaker AI algorithms and created Power BI dashboards.
* **DipJar, Inc.:** Refactored codebase to microservices and integrated Stripe API.
* **Fusion Business Solutions Pvt. Ltd.:** Automated form-filling with AI and NLP.
* **E Connect Solutions Pvt. Ltd.:** Managed development lifecycle with CI/CD and unit testing.

I'm contemplating a Master’s in Finance (MFin) to pivot into consulting, aiming for top programs like:

* LSE
* UCL
* Imperial
* Warwick
* Columbia
* Princeton
* MIT
* LBS

I’m not looking to do an MBA, so I need your insights on the MFin route.

**My main questions are:**

1. **MFin Fit:** Given my background in computer science and business, does an MFin make sense? Will it strengthen my profile for consulting roles and provide a solid career trajectory?
2. **Career Transition:** Has anyone successfully transitioned into consulting with an MFin? Which programs facilitated this transition smoothly?

If you've been in a similar situation or have experience in consulting, I’d love to hear your thoughts and advice. Your insights could be incredibly valuable to me as I navigate this decision.

The company seemed very embarrassed by this decision/recent behavior and promised that we would start regardless of conditions come January. As a retainer, we will be paid 2.5k USD per month. 

Now, I don’t plan on sitting on my hands, and will be looking for business or clinical jobs (consulting was my gap year plan for med school). I know many people have experienced similar situations, and would love any broad advice. I also have some specific ones:

1. In my job search, how do I do present my situation without seeming unemployable or unloyal?

2. Will finding  non-business job for a few months reflect badly if I want to continue working in business and decide against med school? 

3. How have people filled their time during similar delays?

4. Through experience, would you guys recommend conserving money and staying at home, or finding ways to live on my own? 

Thank you guys in advance! While I am very nervous about this free time, I am sure many are in the same situation hope we all get some direction and security soon…",2024-08-12 14:53:16,2,3,0,Positive,0.22062937062937066,0,0,2

The moment university finished and the vast world of opportunities opened, I went into the most confusing state of my life. Life after university abroad is not the same you start to feel like and immigrant. Settling and starting a permanent job with very limited holiday days far away from the family doesn't feel appealing. Marrying eventually a foreigner... different upbringings. Not spending time with your parents and them growing old. Missing home... but life abroad was hardly built... higher salary, more progression. And now you are stuck somewhere in between and cannot decide...

Currently, unemployed for almost half a year, savings almost gone. Still paying rent abroad. But still stuck between the two potential lives, therefore slow with the jobs applications. Cherry of the top, in a serious relationship with a person who I love, but from different, culture, different religion and close to impossible future, but love is blind, isn't it or at least makes us blind? Most logical sounds to break up and go back home, try to make it work there... being with family, better chance of finding someone similar for me for the future... Money? Money would come. But yet I cannot do it, my heart wouldn't let me and there is that longing for my abroad life as well. What would it be? What could it be? But the doom that years are passing and I want to settle somewhere... also is on my shoulders...

Go back home, seek a lost comfort. Change myself  in the name of love and stay abroad. Stay abroad single... but what's the point to most likely end up with another foreigner with more complications? More money... but money is money everything...? Or is all a fear of ending up alone somewhere.",2023-12-22 00:55:23,1,1,0,Positive,0.07505291005291005,0,0,2

This was because I wasn't fully alert during my meeting and this resulted in me not responding to the PIs questions very well.

I landed an internship at one of the Big 4 companies in software development, but I’ve always been more into data analysis and data engineering. I finally found a company offering an internship for a Data Engineer position. They trained me for a month on Power BI, but for the next two months, I was doing web development.. I told them about my concerns, but they reassured me that after the internship, I’d work on data. Also, in the interview, my manager offered me a development job, but I refused because I wanted to focus on data.

I finished the internship and signed a contract as a Data Engineer. But now, my manager wants to move me to the web department. I told him I’m not into web development, especially front end, but he said their projects are data-focused and I’d learn a lot. So, they put me in web, and now I’m supposed to learn .NET, which I really don’t want to do!!! 

I’m stuck. I’ve been looking for other jobs but haven’t found anything yet, and I’m not happy in my current role. Should I talk to my manager again? I’m afraid if I ask him, he might fire me and I’d lose my job, especially since I’m still in my probation period. Is this a stupid idea? I really hate my job right now. 

For context, I have Microsoft certifications in AZ-900 ,PL-300, and DP-900,and I’ve worked on small projects related to data, so I do know my stuff when it comes to data.

Hi everyone,

I hope you're having a great day! I'm facing a tough decision and could really use your opinion.

As an incoming college student, I've always dreamed of attending a specific school, let's call it School A. However, the wait for their acceptance has been anxious, so I applied to another school, School B, as a backup.

To my surprise, School B accepted me quickly! While I'm happy, a part of me still wants to wait for School A's response. Meanwhile, I've been thinking about how each school aligns with my career goals. (Of course, both schools that i applied to has different programs.)

School A is undeniably exciting, offering a fresh start and new experiences. School B, on the other hand, feels a bit unfamiliar as I wouldn't know anyone there. But that's also what makes it thrilling!

And, my biggest concern is finding a comfortable environment to study and grow. While I value my existing relationships, I also crave the chance to meet new people who can support me on this journey.

What do you think? Should I prioritize the familiar at School B or take a leap of faith at School A? ",2024-06-29 11:09:10,3,2,0,Positive,0.22759835194045716,0,0,2

1epss08,careeradvice,Need advice about co workers ,"I am looking for advice on how to work better with my co workers.
I have been a professional nanny for 18 years. I have worked alone for the best part of those 18 years, having sole charge of children-this is quite normal in my particular field. 
I have always had families glowing about what I bring to the job and have always felt very proud and confident in what I do.

Until this year. I’ve had trouble finding the right family fit. I have now started a new job where I am working as part of a team of child carers. 

I am really struggling with this new role. I constantly feel talked over by all three of my coworkers. I will be mid sentence and a coworker will frequently interrupt that sentence-often with something completely different. I have also found that when I am addressed directly, I start to open my mouth to reply and am talked over. This is a frequent occurrence and it is really getting me down. I have tried being more forward-please don’t interrupt me. I have also tried letting them finish then using ‘as I was saying-‘

We had a new co worker come in today. She is completely new. Yet the interrupting has constantly happened today. I was also told by the boss that I am the lead this week yet it’s like she has been trying to tell me what to do all day and also been questioning things I’ve been doing which she has no right to be. For example, getting all children to partake in tidy up- not just the oldest. Considering it was her first day, she is a temp and she was told she is in a supportive, junior role, it really wasn’t her place to question these things. 

All of this lately has really taken a knock on my confidence which has meant I’ve dropped the ball on (albeit very small things) a couple of times-it’s usually because I’m thinking in my head, why has it happened again. It’s really really getting to me.

I am trying to be more forward. I don’t want to be a pushover. I am very mindful to not interrupt my colleagues when they are talking or concentrating.

I am looking for any tips and advice in how to be more forward, stand up for myself without rocking the boat and any phrases I could use. I am more of a gentle soul, which has been highly appreciated in the past. My co workers all have been strong, bubbly personalities which have been hard to stand out from ",2024-08-11 19:10:10,1,0,0,Positive,0.1829584666541188,0,0,2
1emulbp,college,Worst tests/exams/quizzes you’ve ever taken?,"Was recently reminded of a professor who gave us the absolute most annoying tests of all time.

This was a religion course (I went to a Christian school). It was an essay test, where he would give us 3 topics and told us one would be chosen the day of, so we needed to prepare for them all.

Not that bad, kinda hard but also what you expect to see in college.

The annoying part?

We read multiple books in that class (chapter books) and also talked about the Bible a lot. Our essays had to include one Bible verse and one quote from a book. And we were NOT allowed to use any references during the exam. So no Bible or any of the books allowed.

This essentially meant I had to memorize 6 quotes before each exam. Who does that?!

Anyone else have any horrible tests/quizzes/whatever?

Phone calls, setting appointments, driving to appointments, selling advertising/brand marketing, follow up monthly with copy of the ad medium. I have sold advertising before. 

Job 2: W-Su 9-5. Pretty good commission, not sure about residual, but the donor can make recurring donations so maybe. New company, ground floor, with proven system so far, unlimited commission and advancement potential. In person at events asking for donations for a worthy cause. I have never solicited for donations before. Side plus... my youngest kid just got a job with the same days off so I can actually sleep in on my weekend.

Lastly, the economy by most metrics looks bad, and looks to be getting worse. When the economy is bad, I believe advertising sales go down and donations for charity go up. So that is one final bit of info to tip the scales.... Please help?

I am torn. What am I missing? Is my assessment of the economic impact valid? Any advice or insight would be appreciated. Training for the ad job starts Monday, and the donations job on Wednesday.

1ern44e,careeradvice,Should I quit my perfectly fine part time retail job to work in a brand new fast casual food place for the possibility of making more money?,"Ok here’s the long wall of context. I (17M) currently work at Target, I’ll say the names of the companies because my post history references them, but I’ll try not to doxx myself while I’m at.

The job is good, stable, pays well and the management is nice. Minimum wage is 15.69 in my state and this Target is paying me 16.75 hourly. Unlike the posts you’d see at [](https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/), my store is great at meeting my desired hours and working with my ever changing availability. My availability for the upcoming school year has already been approved and my job will work well with my busy schedule full of senior year responsibilities. I’ve honestly never had a job this easy and great, and my only complaint might be the boredom (work in tech department, when there is no truck shipment there is literally nothing to do all day).

Yesterday I applied to a Brazilian fast casual food stall that’s opening at my local mall, purely out of boredom/curiosity, and to my surprise they called me back and said they’re willing to interview this week as they’re opening next week. I asked the manager about the pay and she told me it’s 15 an hour + tips. (In my state it is totally legal to pay food workers less than minimum if tips will make up for it). She told me that in other locations with the brand, tips are around an additional 13-14 dollars per hour per attendant, I applied to a customer facing attendant role. I told her I needed a day to think about it, but she told me that I needed to respond tomorrow. I speak English, Portuguese, and Spanish so languages will not be a problem at this new job.

Here are problems that might arise with working at the new Brazilian food place.

1. The pay might not reflect what I was told in the phone call.
2. The new job might not work well with my availability, I will have a lot of homework and other responsibilities my senior year. I might have to lose sleep many nights.
3. The location is going to be LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT to my old job. I used to work at chick fil a and the job was shit, the managers there know my opinion about the job, and so maybe seeing them everyday now might be a little awkward. I also told myself that I would never go back to food service when I got hired at Target, cause CFA was such a hellhole. It is by far the busiest location at my mall and the lines frequently extend past the food court, no exaggeration.

My current job is really chill and I really enjoy it, I much prefer retail over fast food.

I already paid off my car and have minimal expenses, so money isn’t such a huge issue in my life but the more the merrier, it would be great to have lots stacked up before college next year.

The conclusion comes down to the question in the title, do I quit my perfectly fine retail job that I’m happy at to start something new? Or do I remain where I’m at (will only be there until next summer) and not take the risk?",2024-08-14 00:02:35,27,32,0,Positive,0.1301327670645853,0,0,2

1es9i6l,careeradvice,Am I being taken advantage of?,"I am a brand and web strategist for a small agency. I make between 70-80k/year. My primary role is to do discovery research and write strategic recommendations for brand and web projects. 

My agency’s close rate was becoming alarmingly low so they asked the strategists (there are two of us) to look at the biz dev team’s pitch decks and recommend a new structure. We did. They took my idea and ran with it. They even had the strategists start presenting the pitches. Since then, our close rate has improved ten fold. Not only that but we are scoring bigger and better projects.

Now, biz dev is tapping me and my colleagues for all of the pitches. I am developing at least 1-3 decks a week, presenting them, and writing a good portion of the proposals… while the account manager makes all the commission. 

It would be one thing if the AMs were bringing in new business but they are simply answering direct contact submissions from our website and google ads. They duplicate a proposal template, and have the strategists do the rest. 

I am still also doing my actual job. When I brought up how I feel about this to my boss (one of the owners) she told me that it’s normal for agencies to use strategists this heavily for biz dev without paying commission. And that the AMs don’t make very much money if they aren’t winning commission. But I also feel like AMs have an actual incentive to put work into these proposals because that is their salary… but, for what I’m making a year, I don’t feel motivated at all to win anymore projects for them. I feel like they should give me a sizable raise or let me earn commission for these won accounts. 

Is this normal? Am I being taken advantage of? Am I missing something?",2024-08-14 18:45:45,2,1,0,Positive,0.14490118577075098,0,0,2

1ei8ymr,careeradvice,Do you pick roles that challenge you more or you’re more comfortable in / excel at? ,"
I [30F] recently received two offers for internal product positions at my company (outlined below) and ended up taking the first. I felt like I was heavily influenced by my team because they were more familiar with that team and also have worked with that team in their previous roles. They also claimed I would supposedly grow a lot in that role but I don’t know if this is based off of biases 

Part of my reasoning also was because I knew I definitely would be challenged more in this role. However now I’m getting a little anxious knowing that this would be new territory for me and that my hiring manager is also virtual to me. I know there’s no going back but I can’t help but wonder why I also didn’t take the second knowing that the team culture and leaders would be great.

Wondering what others take into consideration when they search for their next opportunity?

Also does it look bad if I wanted to reapply to that team again later on (at my company they encourage internal movement a lot to retain talent)?

For background I’m a product manager that is more on the GTM side and I wanted to get more technical experience.

1) Front end digital platform product management / development 

Pros: 
- this role is a highly visible role because so many different products operate on this platform so I would really need to understand the hierarchy of how these products are all set up
- the team is very well known in my org 
- both my manager and VP were very well connected to the hiring manager and VP
- I would definitely grow more in terms of owning more requirements and driving features forward 
- there are very tenured people on the team (not older necessarily but they are definitely SMEs)
- same org 

Cons:
- the hiring manager is virtual (to me) and commutes into a different office
- there’s a 3 hr time difference between me and the hiring manager 
- the team is a little scattered location wise 
- it would be a really big learning curve for me
- it’s a new role 


2) Digital product operations 

Pros:
- this is a more operational and tactical role and I’m very familiar with this type of work and know i would naturally be really good at this work 
- I really got along with the hiring manager and VP
- the team is all based at the same location as me 
- the team culture seems great and the team seems to really like the hiring manager 

Cons:
- it seems like there have been some people that have left the team due to pursuing other internal opportunities for more growth 
- it’s in a completely different org (that being said I was also interested in this org)

","

Okay beautiful reddit users, I need your help. I am entering my last year of undergrad as a 5th year and I am getting my majors in Human Bio BS and Chemistry BA at a large state university. My gpa sucks; 2.8 chem and 2.4 human bio, 2.639 cum. I started during covid and had a terrible time adjusting after going from online to in person. Not only did I struggle with this adjustment, I had to tackle on some major personal and mental health issues my entire junior year while at the same time numerous students were committing suicide at my school. I was able to dial back in and improve in my grades and mental health my senior year, but it was not enough for me to graduate on time nor to raise my gpa. I probably should have taken a gap year to save my GPA, but I chose to try and take on the course work anyway and obtained 6 F’s in a year. 



I have discovered my passion for biological/biochemical oceanography and I would love to pursue this degree in research at a graduate program. I am reaching out to professors at my school within the field in order to get some lab experience and to see if I would enjoy research in this subject. I have a much better support system and various peers/colleagues that encourage me to go for graduate school and to really network in this last year. I am planning to do a very general range of applications and if I do not get in, I plan to work with my university to continue research after obtaining a bachelor’s. I appreciate all and any advice, as well as the tough love. Thank you to all!

During the initial years of my engineering studies, I discovered a passion for software development and started learning coding online. By the time I reached my final year, I had become a better coder than most of my classmates.

In my 8th semester, I began applying for off-campus internships and placements since we didn't have any on-campus recruitment.

1ejzh55,careeradvice,Tech Sales Warning - Need Advice Giving Notice,"Earlier this year I started working for a company that is (in)famous for its shady business practices with targeted lead generation specializing in home improvement services. I wanted to try something new and work remotely. It worked out well for awhile but let me tell you… 

This job sucks DO NOT work here. 

In the last month several policy changes have been made that have made this job go from worth the grind to absolute BS.

* The sales quota to qualify for better quality leads via online sign ups was raised. If you take a vacation or are ever sick or take a one day off you will get behind and lose progress. 
* Policy changes regarding weekend shifts. Weekend shifts get you certain leads. Employees used weekend shifts strategically for appointments and lead opportunities. Changes now make this difficult
* If you sold a certain amount you didn’t have to complete the dial/talk time minimum of 1000 calls a week OR 15 hours a week. This was changed “temporarily” several months ago and now everyone needs to meet it. This temporary policy was recently extended. It will probably stay in place for the foreseeable future
* And the big kicker… corporate dropped the bomb a few weeks ago that there will be essentially a 60% REDUCTION in the compensation plan for the same number of sales. Which they heavily denied at first and tried to obfuscate.

What I liked about my job is that my team was great. The salespeople on my team are incredible and smart. My manager is super nice and very supportive. 

What I HATE about my job is the awful feeling I have about the sales I make. The meeting about the compensation plan opened up a whole can of worms. Many people expressed their resentment for the lack of support and declining quality of the product. It is a hard job and sales people get very little help in supporting their contractors/pros. There is no spanish app and no plan to make one. Only a few teams have spanish speakers. We are expected to talk to and sign up contractors who speak little to no english. Most contractors I call need their kid to translate and this is not unusual. I feel they cannot agree to entering an agreement with us without a full understanding. And I cannot guarantee they understand everything being translated/communicated to them.

Many top sales people are going to leave when the compensation plan kicks in later this month. I’m ready to leave and want to write a letter giving notice. Any advice? I am a new employee so I don’t want to get my manager in trouble. Do I bother giving two weeks since it’s a sales job and they fire us at the drop of a hat anyways?",2024-08-04 16:36:34,1,0,0,Positive,0.06003063157081013,0,0,2

1eqk3em,careeradvice,Am I on track for getting into senior management ?,"Hello,

I have been at this company for 6 years now, ever since I finished college. Company is an international corp, and I initially joined a freshly created tech team.

Have a pretty nice manager (same since I started) who has always given me positive reviews and promotion/raise. In fact, in retrospect, I am pretty well compensated since I think I am on the high end of the market while never had to change company to get a bump (my annualized raise is about 15%, which might be standard for career start in my field, but usually requires you to switch companies).

Even had the chance to complete assignments abroad that gave me exposure to high level executives who praised my technical work, straight up to the CEO himself. My manager straight up told me he told HR I was a high potential employee, and I know for a fact that they have those meetings with HR and senior management to discuss about successions plans, and it does sound like my name has been brought up on different occasions.

I have recently been offered a middle management position at the same company but on a different country, with great expat advantages and a 5 year contract, but I have been thinking a lot about my career lately. 

To be honest, I never thought I would stay in this company that long as I always thought I would end up in a tech companies doing state of the art stuff and not just regular big corporate trying to catch up but still late tech.

Also, I know for a fact that the team I would be managing is pretty lacking in terms of technical skills, which higher management is perfectly aware of since I was asked to evaluate them (and now asked to upskill them).

That being said, I did enjoy leading some projects without being deep in the technical, just enough, to be able to orchestrate how things go, deadline, communication between individual contributors and senior management etc ..

Do you think I should seize this opportunity ? Is it a once in a lifetime opportunity for an introvert like me who don't really have this vibrant personality (which seems to be the biggest criteria to go into senior management position) ? Or do you think I should try and finally get a new job in a tech company, ideally a FAANG ?

If you want money for college, you should submit a [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) if you are eligible to do so. [Click here](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements) to review eligibility requirements.

2021-2022 school year: Use the 2021-2022 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2020. Requires 2019 tax information.

2022-2023 school year: 2022-2023 FAFSA will became available October 1, 2021. Requires 2020 tax information.

**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide.**

* Create an [FSA account](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch) (also known as the FSA ID). This is your legal electronic signature to sign the FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well, assuming they have an SSN. If your parent already has their own FSA account, they must use that. If your parent does not have an SSN, they must print and sign the signature page manually, then mail it in.

* Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

* Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

Do not guess on the FAFSA. If you have a question, post here or [contact the Federal Student Aid Info Center](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/contact).",2021-08-26 04:27:46,1121,2681,0,Positive,0.17592592592592593,0,0,2

1b40zcj,stress,Dealing with the Critics in Your Life,"Whatever you’re trying to achieve - save the world, write a novel, devote yourself to a particular cause – there are likely to be those who will be critical. Some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour. Criticism is unavoidable. Your choice is in how to respond to it.   
  
  
Consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life:  
  
Clarify your purpose. As humans, we are compelled to make meaning. Making meaning for ourselves – and value for others – is fundamental to a life well lived. When you’re doing something very important to you, you care far less about the criticisms of others. If they can easily throw you off your path, you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you. Are you living your purpose consistent with your values?  
  
Understand the critic’s motivation. Are they projecting themselves in to the situation – their aspirations, their skill set, their propensity for risk, their values? Are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential down-sides? Are they trying to maintain the status quo – for you, them, or both? Are they masking their own lack of action?   
  
Recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal. We have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones. We are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement: people working against us over people supporting us. Most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it.  
  
Realize that you’re going to be criticized no matter what you do. Whether you become a billionaire, movie star, teacher, doctor, or sit on the couch all day, there is someone that will tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing. So, live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics don’t want.  
  
Respond calmly. Rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response, respond kindly with a considered response. Acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making.   
  
  
  
Use your critics as motivation. While some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world, others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation. Remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines, you are on the pitch and playing the game.  
  
Decide if they have something useful to say. Some criticism may carry valid points – explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be – the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue. If the criticism isn’t useful, move on. You have more important things to do.  
  
Take criticism as a compliment. Most people will leave you alone if you’re struggling or aren’t doing anything noteworthy. You only become a significant target of negative comments if you’re doing well. If you’re taking a lot of heat, you must be doing something correct!  
  
Live your life without the need for the approval of others. Live your own life, by your own values. Use your signature strengths to create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future in your chosen pursuit.

Should I correct them? My name is already misspelled on official reports, a master thesis as co-supervisor and a poster submitted by someone else. My name is misspelled on an article currently under review. 

I usually don’t want to make a fuss of it, but it is my first name. I know that it will often be abbreviated so the spelling mistake is hidden, but I am starting to receive more and more emails with my name spelled wrong. Am I overthinking this? 

My IT department spelled my name wrong for my Microsoft office user so all comments I make in word files show my name spelled wrong, which probably is the source of most of the misspellings in the past year. They claim to have fixed it twice but it has not been fixed.

1epqaaw,careeradvice,Should i quit my current job a couple of weeks earlier than they want? ,"Hello!

So i have a choice to make and it makes mw nervous and anxious af. 
So im currently a line cook in a famous restaurant in my city and the team im with is almost perfect for me. 
Though i would like to try something different thats more appealing to me.

I found a bakery/pastry shop which is more in line with what i want to do, and they told me that it will open at the end of August (24th).
Before i started working in my current position in the restaurant, i made it clear that i will work for them until the end of August, and then we will talk again. Ideally they would prefer me to work for them until the 15th of September.

Problem is that the new employer wants me to start asap (when it opens, either on the 24th or the week of 26th- ).

The new job will definitely pay better and will be more into what i like but my current position isnt bad at all and the team im with is excellent, every day i learn something new.

I really want to get to a good closure without being seen as the douchebag who abandoned them.",2024-08-11 17:25:07,1,1,0,Positive,0.2522727272727273,0,0,2

1elymhp,careeradvice,I was drugged on a work trip and acted out. Now being investigated by HR.,"Had drinks with a local friend of my coworker and he suggested a second venue. We walked over and he let me hit his vape. I thought it was normal weed but later he mentioned spice — which I avoid like the plague. I should mention we flew in from the UK to a legal state. I’m still not sure if it was the vape or something else in the club.

But I was fine after drinks (had about 4 beers) buzzed but in control. I was fine enough to get carded and given a wristband at the door. And I was fine for ten or so minutes after that. I only had a water at the club and didn’t leave my coworkers’ sight who I should mention are all 30 or approaching it (I’m 25). I’m the most junior of the bunch. 

It was catastrophic. I made a fool of myself on the dance floor, shoved some people and then literally died. Got narcaned and lifted out by the police where I suppose the adrenaline was enough that I was lucid and convinced them I was fine. But someone had just told my coworker that the narcan would be short lived and that the effects of whatever was in my system would return. And they did.

I was a complete mess. Screaming and punched a dudes car window. Hurt my fist and elbow pretty bad and fell backwards on my head. I don’t recall any of this. I was sitting in the back of the cruiser cuffed when apparently the cops just decided to send me to the hospital.

Met later with my coworkers and apologized. They were obviously shook up but we laughed it off and implicitly agreed to leave the shitshow behind us. We were good. Sadly, I had a work related disagreement with one of them. And now HR had been made aware. The story is I was negligent of my duties. God knows what they told them about the incident but I’m to plead my case soon. Have to work from home but I just took unpaid leave because I just can’t… 

While I was apologizing it did seem they were planting seeds for their potential extrication. They asked me if I “took” anything. That was pretty offensive but I shrugged it off. I didn’t. They all hit the vape. But only I had my reaction. Then they started saying that while I was freaking out I grabbed one of their wrists pretty hard and left a bruise but they said that I was panicking and they bruise very easily so they said it was fine. The other (who’s a friend of the first coworker). Said I smacked his chest in the club but I remember that and I was fooling around with a sticker I found on the table tried to put it on his chest. Annoying and stupid but I was not fucked at this point and was probably fooling around from the alcohol. I apologized and we laughed it off. 

The event was pretty traumatizing. Hospital staff didn’t really tell me what happened. Just diagnosed with me with altered mental status. I’m on ssris so maybe there was an interaction there but I just don’t know. I’m just so alone and confused. Feel like they’re using the event to start a witch hunt because of the work related disagreement. I understand that they are probably quite shocked too but what happened was not me. I was not in control but from the tone of my manager, it seems they gave the impression that I had intention.

I’m probably done for but how can I make them see that this wasn’t my fault? I’m apologetic but I’ve never take something that made me behave this way. I don’t know what to do. ",2024-08-07 00:59:25,315,115,0,Positive,0.05201923076923079,0,0,2

1erywot,careeradvice,Prioritize location/support or time/career advancement?,"I need advice on a career move

I'm interviewing for a job in robotics with a company that has been contracted by a major company, like top teir company that is a dream job for many. I currently have some robotics experience in an adjacent field and feel I have a decent shot at landing the job. It will be a fairly significant pay increase and the time home will be one of the biggest benefits. I'll be working 4-10's and have Fri, Sat, and Sun off and home every night. Versus what I do now which is a 3 week on and 3 week off rotation which takes me away from home for those three weeks. 

The biggest downside is the requirement to relocate to a city where we don't know anyone and leave our support system of friends and family. We have 3 small children ages 4 and under and can use all the help we can get. Especially when I have to leave my wife for long periods of time. Also the city we would be moving to would be a downgrade as far as schools and quality of life. We are currently in a nice suburb of a major city that has everything you could want for entertainment. The city we would be moving to isn't small but would not be the same. 

The potential job has a much better outlook as far as future employment too as I see robotics growing exponentially in the coming years. My current job is quite stagnant in comparison but still growing. 

Pros: more money and time home

Cons: worse schools and town without friends and family, also selling my house with a 3% interest rate

What happened to me?

Is there something wrong with me?

I don't get excited. I'm not excitable. Really. I get told that something is happening, and I don't dread it or worry either. I'm just there. 

I don't smile. I don't frown or scowl either. People say I look upset. I'm not upset. I'm also not the smiley type.


I don't like seeing family. When I do I just feel like I'm holding my breath. It's at the point where my mom would rather I not come to events. I don't cause trouble, but would also rather not be there. 

I don't like seeing friends or the people who are supposed to be friends by extension of my wife. I saw some the other weekend and couldn't stop thinking about everything I was falling behind at home. Then this week her new job has some mandatory fun next weekend, and I'm still exhausted from seeing people last month. I said no thanks. She said she would take our daughter to the event without me. I said please do.

My work had a luncheon, ie, mandatory fun. I'm a  teacher, and it was the last event before summer. We had to come in just for this mandatory fun, and all I want is to be out of there. The whole time I wondered how and when I could get out. I thought maybe if I fall and jerk my head, the mandatory nonsense would be over
a teacher and it was the last event before summer.  

I don't think I'm depressed.

I used to work out a ton, but then I tore my Achilles a second time. It's been a rough recovery. 

I used to play video games as a me time. Then my wife got pregnant and we had to move to a new house. Then we had a daughter. I love my daughter, but I haven't played video games since when I moved.

There's constant work to do in this house, and if I let the grass grow too much, it'll be more of a pain to mow. Two weekends in a row it rained, and when I finally mowed it was way too long. I also killed a baby bird by accident since I couldn't see it in the high grass. I don't want that to happen again.

My HVAC unit went out in March.. Replacing it was 30g. I know. A few weeks later, my wife's junker car required 2k to fix, and it seemed more reasonable to finally get a car that would help the baby. Suddenly two more payments a month. 
Then two weeks later she got a good review on Tuesday and was fired Friday. 

It took two months for her to get a new job. In the meantime I was picking up all kinds of side gigs and tutoring hours. 
I was working 6-7 days a week.

I don't like holidays. It's just more work. I'd rather to work than the the extra work from home.

And there were 6 other participants who had yet to contribute anything at all. I asked about it. No one responded. What I know is that I was not writing those memo's. I had done enough. I had to study too. So I asked them (privately) why they hadn't been contributing. Only 3 responded. I asked them to please help. PLEASE HELP. 2 did so without complain. The 1 of the 3 told me she had a lot on her hands.( THE SAME CAN BE SAID ABOUT ANY COLLEGE STUDENT JUST TRYING TO PASS WELL.)  asked her what about the nature of her problems. He didn't say. I asked what was better about her problems.

The reason i quit my previous job was because it was in North Dakota and i had to work 4 weeks straight in order to get 10 days off. My hometown is in south tx.

I overheard my boss talking shit about me and it sounds like i will be placed in PIP anytime soon. I constantly ask for assignments but i get turned down 99% of the time by all my superiors.

One of the reasons i accepted the position is so that i could do a lateral transfer. The thing is that i don’t process any technical skills.

1dr3zb4,academia,I hate the other undergrad in my lab,"TL;DR : I hate the undergrad I work with. He’s got a 4.0, micromanages me and my imposter syndrome makes it hard for me to set boundaries. 

Hate is a strong word and I use it for almost no one. I hate maybe 3 people total. Chad is one of them.

I (F 20) work in a lab at my university. We’ve got a second undergrad (m 20) in the lab let’s call him Chad. 

We’ve both been with this lab either through research courses or term long lab projects for over a year now. We didn’t get along a year ago where we first met but now are the primary undergrads working as RA’s on our Labs Major Grant project. 

Chad’s got a 4.0 which is rather impressive. I admired him and his work ethic for a while minus some of his more quirkier personality traits. I’ve come to realize his lack of people and communication skills are starting to hinder my ability to work amicably in the lab. We hold the same position but he micromanages me more than the post doctoral fellow actually monitoring our work.

I love leading but I also don’t mind if someone comes in and wants to boss people around as long as they do it well. The problem with Chad is, he wants to do all the work by himself which is hard to do when 2 people need to quality check the data. He can’t QC for two people that defeats the purpose. He also has the tendency to do tasks in the longest possible way he can come up with. He’s the type to rather manually input values into an excel sheet rather than produce a formula (mainly bc he doesn’t know how) and if I go in do that he basically just does it manually anyways.

He’s always too quick to double the work unnecessarily. He makes changes to templates he shouldnt be or alter criteria for QC without checking. The first time it happened he immediately took the fall for it but now he’s starting to do it again and I am not interested in wasting my time like he is. He lives a cushy life with supportive parents in the upper class and no social life. 

If we get 3 weeks to complete a task he’ll tell everyone “the two of us will have it done this Sunday.” He’s able to drop everything and have it done then complain to people when I don’t (even though again, we had 3 weeks) and I still get it done early. I don’t have the privilege Chad does of dropping all my responsibilities. I don’t live a cushioned life. No hate I respect his work ethic but unlike him I can understand and empathize with others.  He keeps justifying his horrible behaviour and superiority complex by saying “sorry I just like to finish things quickly.” I’m sure you do buddy.

You can’t rush research. 

I’m just annoyed and don’t know how to handle this guy. He has a perfect gpa and my imposter syndrome stops me from putting him in his place. 

I need advice.

I've always been interested in computers and math, but I decided to settle (or at least I feel like I did) for a business degree. Currently, I'm working as an administrative assistant. Lately, I've been contemplating a major change in my career path, and I'm trying to navigate through two options.

My current position ties into the insurance industry, though I'm not currently licensed. Recently, my manager mentioned that he thinks I would make a good insurance agent. He also mentioned that getting licensed could lead to an estimated 50% increase in my salary. He believes I have the right fit for the role. I would just need to pay for obtaining the Georgia Property & Casualty licensing fees.

On the other hand, I have a buddy from undergrad who's working in the cybersecurity industry. He often talks about how great his job is, working remotely and making double my current salary. He's offered to guide me through the transition, and he feels confident that I have the competence to make it.

So, I'm at a crossroads. Do I pursue the insurance path with a tangible pay raise and the backing of my current manager? Or do I take a leap into cybersecurity, a field I'm genuinely interested in, with the potential for a significant increase in salary and the perks of remote work?",2024-08-07 05:12:51,0,0,0,Positive,0.12264610389610389,0,0,2

1e66o1e,academia,Is it accademia right for me?,"Hello,

I completed my master's degree in environmental economics at a reputable university in Italy at the beginning of 2024. During my studies, I had the opportunity to study abroad twice, first in Norway and then in the Netherlands. However, I was more focused on the travel experience than on academics.

My main priority during both my bachelor's and master's programs was to finish as quickly as possible, so I did not aim for high grades. Shortly after completing my master's, a professor from a prestigious Italian university invited me to join his research team. While I felt honored by the offer, I wasn't ready to commit to a PhD program. Currently, I am four months into a 1.5-year scholarship, after which they expect me to join their PhD program.

However, I am feeling uncomfortable in this position. The research team seems much more knowledgeable than I am, and I often feel inadequate. Moreover, I never really wanted to continue studying; I accepted the offer because I felt honored. I don't want to be like a fish judged by its ability to climb a tree.

What are your suggestions? Do you think four months is enough time to decide if this path is right for me? Should I drop this opportunity as soon as possible? Regarding the PhD they expect me to pursue, do you think I can complete this year and then not officially join the team?

","[Ecotherapy](https://ecotherapy.online/nature-everyday-life/) is an enticing way to improve our mental and physical health by reconnecting with nature in today's fast-paced, technologically driven cities. This blog extensively examines the principles of ecotherapy, as well as its benefits and practical advice for incorporating its restorative features into everyday life.

**Integrating ecotherapy into everyday life**

**Morning Schedule**

Spend some time in nature to start your day.

* Start with a quick stroll around a nearby park or forest. Take some time to enjoy the surrounding natural environment's sights, sounds, and scents.

* Exercise consciousness Spend some time being mindful of the natural environment. Pay attention to your breath, the movement of the trees, or the sound of birds tweeting to help you focus for the upcoming day.

**Establishing Green Space**

Bring the outside into your home and workplace.

* Bring the outdoors in and spruce up your living space with indoor plants. They provide a bit of extra greenery to your surroundings in addition to cleaning the air.

* If you have the space, cultivate a garden in your backyard or on your balcony. Having your own flowers, vegetables, or herbs gives you a sense of accomplishment and connection to nature's cycles.

**Outdoor Activities**

Make time in your calendar for everyday outdoor activities:

* Find local trails or wilderness regions. Hiking and biking not only get you moving but also allow you to enjoy the breath-taking sights of the surrounding area.

* Take part in community gardening projects to meet like-minded individuals and enhance the green spaces in your town.

1emmfpg,careeradvice,Possibly stepping back from CFO position,"I'm not sure where to start because I really did not think I would be in this position. I guess a little bit about me is that I am the Chief Financial Officer of a large industrial services company (500M+ revenue) that is a business unit for a top 10 market cap public company. I have been in this role for four years, and I am a forty year old male. I came into this role after very successful runs in financial planning and analysis as a leader at other fast-rising companies, and made the switch making it through my earn-out and selling my equity in my last company after a selling to private equity. I've been considered a thought leader throughout my career, and am generally regarded highly in our industry and within my company. 

Things have truthfully been pretty successful. Profitability has been good, I've successfully integrated a couple of acquisitions, I am on a lot of the larger companies counsels for steering things, etc. Unfortunately, my background had very little exposure to an area where this unit has been historically weak: Billing. I have been attempting reshape our billing and collections for three years now, and it honestly just keeps getting worse. While we have made great strides in other areas like automation, forecasting, operational close, capital planning, etc., I actually think we've gone backwards in this area despite changing up the department and processes. 

I am pretty much at the end about it. I have never really had anything academically or professionally where I failed, but I am demoralized about this area. It is hugely problematic, and I've leaned on other leaders in the company, consultants, and other things to no avail. It's a big negative impact for the company, and I am out of ideas. I am certainly at an inflection point where I think it will stain the other things I have accomplished as a leader, and I quite frankly am feeling totally burnt out with it. 

At this point I am considering taking a step back. The invoicing environment in this company has historically been bad, and I know the industry as a whole is considered lousy, so I'm not an outlier. But I am pretty demoralized. I am considering going back to a lower role in a different company for a while to rehab myself. 

I'm not sure what advice I really need, but I know I am at a bit of a crossroads. The tone of this certainly does not reflect it, but I am usually a very positive person (which I think is partially how I've been successful in past difficult situations) and the negativity of this is really impacting my mental health. I think it would be a black mark for my career to take a step back, but I mentally and emotionally cannot keep up with the toll of this. I have two young kids and a wife I want to be there for fully, and this type of failure really creeps into my energy in all areas. I'm not mean, but I just do not have it out of here. 

I was accepted to a top executive MBA program that I wanted to attend a year ago to fill out the margins for me in some non-quantitative areas, so I have been thinking if I were to step back I'd create some bandwidth for myself to pursue that. I don't know if it is worth that either, because at this point I'm not sure if I am up to the rigors of the top flight management of a company. My analytical skills are very strong, I'm great at presentations, etc., but I do not really have much experience outside of finance. Becoming a bit more well-rounded and recharging seems like a plus right now. 

Sorry for being an Eeyore about this subject. I just am not feeling up to the task, and honestly I do not even know if I can take it until I find another job. Has anyone here ever taken a few year step back and felt up to things afterward? I appreciate any encouragement or honest answers.",2024-08-07 20:27:46,3,4,0,Positive,0.07909186052043198,0,0,2

I'm currently at a community college with plans to transfer to a state university, but I'm really struggling to figure out what to major in. I’ve always had a deep passion for history, but I know that a degree in history doesn’t exactly open the door to the highest-paying jobs, especially here in California.

That’s why I’m turning to you all, what are some of the more profitable degrees that can transition into high-paying jobs in California? I feel like if I’m not going to be super passionate about my major, I might as well choose something that will set me up financially.

I am interested in moving on to a Regional Manager role with a non-group fitness gym brand.

ok so i pretty much live in a collegetown. unfortunately though i go to a community college right down the road from said college it’s like a couple minutes away. i’m not transferring until over a year. so i’ll be stuck here for a while. my school is almost empty every time i’m on campus. the students are mostly older adults or even elders. there’s like 0 clubs or anything. 

i swear it feels like everybody my age in my area goes to this university. during football season i’d see so many students from there walk past my school as i would sit in an empty lab looking through the window. like im not asking for a full blown college experience. but man i just want some friends. it’s a pretty demoralizing feeling. watching most people my age living their best lives just 5 minutes away from me. 

do universities typically do any events or clubs or anything for non students to join? obviously i know catching a football game is a big option but how in the world would i make friends if i’m going by myself and everybody else is in their own established circle of friends?

i’m not a huge drinker (nor am i 21 yet) so bars are a no go. parties im fine with but how can i be in one if i don’t even know anyone to begin with. i’d say im quite the social person. it’s just all i need is a chance. but i don’t know how and where.

1ehm8iq,careeradvice,How to get ahead of incompetent coworkers?,"I'm having a time and a half right now.

Our timekeeping software shit the bed nationwide, and it was on me to create the Excel spreadsheet to track our employee's timekeeping for payroll for this week and beyond.

The problems arise when my coworker proceeded to prove that she was completely incompetent in Excel and payroll is damn near late because, while she can take directions fairly well, she distracts me from double checking the math every 5 seconds because Excel ""isn't calculating it automatically."" She uses the mouse exclusively to copy/paste, has no clue about keyboard shortcuts. She doesn't know how to use the SUM function (goes up to the top to do autosum but doesn't know how to select multiple cells), she doesn't understand how to do the math with functions outside of pen and paper and she keeps breaking it because ""Well when we do it in (X) program, we HAVE to do it like this!!!"" And I've tried explaining to her that Excel doesn't care, but my functions do, and my reference page is useless when she keeps breaking the punches off at 6am and creating a new row. 

I admit that I'm not an Excel wizard or an expert, but I have allowed our employees to have their time calculated and actually get paid (albeit at the very last minute this week) so a win is a win in my eyes. But I am completely exhausted by this experience and my inflexible coworker who so rigidly adheres to this archaic version of payroll processing.

She wants me to do it exactly the way she does it, has me printing out 90+ pages of paper per week to look for errors or find missing punches completely by hand. It seems to work for her, but all I can see is shortcuts. 

I'm just an ""accounting assistant"" (that's my title but I don't feel like that's what I really am). My supervisor is an ""experience only"" type of accounting department lead, she doesn't have a degree and we contract with a CPA to check our books. Everything she's learned, she's learned through experience, but it's hard for me to understand exactly what she knows aside from the different OT laws where our employees work. She seems highly unconcerned with the process because ""it works and what if the new way isn't as fast as you think it is?"" But it really doesn't work because we process on average like a batch of 6-7 retro pay requests from employees a week. On top of the 200 employees across 4-5 different states, entering in punches to the system directly, cross-checking (meaning typing in each individual employee number and checking to see if they have clock ins, clock outs, and meal breaks - yes, purely manually), sending up to 6-12 follow up emails per area asking why Person A went over their shift by 30min, asking why Person B's absence wasn't put in the system and why the schedule wasn't changed accordingly, it's too much.

That's why they hired me in the first place, to help the Payroll lead (who gets paid more than me and works from home, which is a kick in the face to my pride) but this??? I might as well be in the stone age.

I'm burnt out after this week and I've only been at this job for two months. I want to make everything about payroll more efficient so that it doesn't take us 3.5 days (I'm not joking) to process pay for 200 people and STILL end up having things calculated incorrectly.

I'm just not sure how I can get anyone to listen to me. :/ The job otherwise just consists of me doing bank reconciliations, A/P entry, and invoices in QBO and listening to audiobooks, so it's incredibly easy on my brain and I'm happy here. But the payroll thing is driving me crazy.

Sorry this is so long, but does anyone have any advice on how to navigate this?

I am new to this community (and Reddit), but am looking for advice on productivity tools, apps, or systems that you all recommend. 

I currently work in healthcare (focus is sports medicine) and am involved in a few areas such as patient care, resident mentoring, teaching, research projects, and some other minor supervisory roles projects. Many of these roles began this year, so my workload has increased (hence this post). 

My health system is embedded in the Microsoft realm, so I am locked into using Outlook. I use Dropbox as my storage as it works seamlessly across my work and personal devices. I also use Zotero for my reference management. 

I am curious about apps for things such as personal writing as ideas come to me and/or for notetaking. Also for task management focused apps as I have many projects with different individuals (both in my system and externally) happening simultaneously. Any other apps you all find useful would be great as well.

1eoa02e,careeradvice,I USED AI TO AUTOMATICALLY APPLY FOR 1000 JOBS - AND I GOT 50 INTERVIEWS!,"# How Did I Do It?

I created an AI bot that:

* Analyzes candidate information
* Examines job descriptions
* Generates unique CVs and cover letters for each job
* Answers specific questions that recruiters ask
* Automatically applies to jobs

And all of this while I was sleeping! In just one month, this method helped me secure around 50 interviews. The tailored CVs and cover letters, customized based on each job description, made a significant difference.

# AI is Changing the Game

Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the recruiting landscape:

* Job seekers can optimize their CVs in seconds
* Cover letters are crafted with a click
* Perfect matching between skills and job offers
* Recruiters are using automated screening systems

This method is incredibly effective at passing through automated screening systems. By generating CVs and cover letters tailored to each job description, my script significantly increases the chances of getting noticed by both AI and human recruiters.

# Questions for the Future

* Will human recruiters become obsolete?
* How will we distinguish real talent in a sea of seemingly perfect applications?
* Are we entering an ""AI arms race"" in recruiting?

# Soft Skills: The New Differentiator?

In a world of AI-optimized applications:

* Empathy
* Creativity
* Critical thinking

Could become the real distinguishing factors.

# Personal Reflection

Observing this technological revolution, I can't help but reflect on the profound implications for the world of work. While efficient, the automation of job applications raises questions about the very nature of professional relationships. We face a paradox: as we seek to optimize the selection process, we risk losing the human element that often makes a difference in a work environment. The challenge ahead is not just technological, but also ethical and social. We'll need to find a delicate balance between the efficiency of artificial intelligence and the richness of human interactions. Only then can we build a future of work that is not just productive, but also fulfilling and meaningful for everyone.

# Want to Try This Magic?

Here's what it does:

* Enter your professional background
* It generates tailored CVs, cover letters, and responses
* Sends hundreds of applications while you enjoy a coffee

Curious? Try it here: [GitHub Project](https://github.com/feder-cr/linkedIn_auto_jobs_applier_with_AI)

(My project is completely free and open source, unlike other similar services that cost a lot and offer very little value. Since it’s still in beta, every star on GitHub is a huge encouragement to keep developing it!)

1eqskkq,college,completely messed up my college timeline and idk what to do anymore,"i really don't know where to go for advice for this.

i screwed up big time. a general rundown of my college experience so far:

-get admitted to big university.

-chicken out and withdraw to go to CC for a semester.

-end up going to a different university for Spring semester.

-enroll for fully online courses in my major for next Fall to avoid getting apartment and save on rent.

-last-minute panic switch to new major because career prospects are grim

-no classes offered for my new major online

i don't have any way of living near campus at the moment because sublease rent prices are criminally high. my host university does not allow courses to be taken transiently at my CC. i have too many AP + college credits to fully enroll at my CC again because then I'd be in excess credits. I could potentially wipe my APs off my transcript, but then i'm looking at another year of college because my APs cover almost every GEP requirement. i'm honestly looking to transfer to a nearby uni for spring semester, but regardless of where i end up in the spring i'll be falling behind an entire semester because i have no major-related nor GEP courses i can take with my current uni, not to mention the extra year i spent working toward the wrong major. i'm watching all of my friends who took the conventional 4 year college route enjoying themselves while my 2 year AA friends are finishing up and getting ready to transfer. meanwhile i keep self sabotaging my college career. i was so fortunate to have nearly all of my GEPs done with AP credit, and my tuition is completely paid for by bright futures. but now i notice that even with all these advantages that were supposed to help me stay ahead, ive once again fallen behind. yes, i know its entirely my fault. ive heard enough of that already. i just want to find a solution, but every idea ive had either leaves me in the same predicament or it dives through some risky education system loopholes that i dont want to fuck around with.

1eowbva,careeradvice,Need advice navigating office politics amid promotion ,"Need Advice!

Context:

I work in HR for a mid-sized company in the Southern U.S. My job is fine, though it’s a bit boring as it’s not very challenging. I report directly to a Senior VP, who in turn reports to the CEO. There’s also an AVP who reports to my boss. I hold a Senior Lead title. I’m very appreciative of my boss, as he provided me with this opportunity and has been understanding about work-life balance. However, due to personal matters, my partner and I are facing increased financial needs.

The Story:

Early last week, I received an email from the CEO requesting a meeting. I mentioned it to my boss as a courtesy. He told me I might be in line for a promotion that would have me reporting directly to the CEO and warned me that working with him can be challenging.

Later that day, I met with the CEO, who offered me a newly created AVP role with a 40% pay increase—a game changer for both my career and life! I was told that I would be inheriting 60% of my boss’s portfolio due to “structural changes.” I was incredibly excited. The CEO asked me to give him an answer within three business days.

During my one-on-one with my boss, he seemed clearly frazzled and asked about the meeting. It was palpable. On the same day, I scheduled a meeting with the other AVP to understand the CEO’s dynamics, assuming everyone was already aware of the change, especially since the AVP and my boss are close.

Anyway, the CEO called me later and asked what I shared with the VP because, according to him, the VP “seems to be adjusting to the change,” which I interpreted as being upset. The CEO was adamant about the change and requested that I not discuss it with anyone, except loved ones, until my new contract is finalized and he informs the Board.

The Dilemma:

Now, I have a meeting scheduled with the other AVP, but I’m thinking of canceling or shifting the focus. I’m nervous about sharing anything since the AVP has to be aware of the changes, and I don’t want to upset anyone. He even called me on Friday morning to discuss another project and mentioned he’s looking forward to our meeting next week.

How would you navigate this situation? I don’t want to upset my boss, but I’m also wary of the AVP’s motives. I want to respect the CEO’s wishes and avoid causing any disruption within the leadership team. I’m a bit concerned about the dynamics at play, but I also understand that power and money can make people protective of their positions.

Should I still have the meeting with the AVP? If so, what should I focus on? How can I navigate this situation while maintaining a good rapport with my supervisor? I have a feeling he’ll ask questions.",2024-08-10 15:55:02,1,4,0,Positive,0.06218443172988626,0,0,2

1eilb3v,careeradvice,Seeking Guidance: Navigating Career Challenges and Big Decisions Abroad.,"I need some advice because I'm really unsure what to do. I moved here (couple years ago) for a promotion in the same holding group, but in a different location (I'm foreign). I had two bosses—one in the U.S. and another in Asia where the headquarters is. Both of them liked me, and everything was fine. Then my U.S. boss relocated to Australia, and I took over his job. My boss in Asia was supportive. 

However, a couple months ago, my former boss (who was living in Australia) requested to come back to the U.S. for family reasons. My boss in Asia, who is very close to him, and also facing there was not chances to give any job in any other area, created another role above me, effectively downgrading me. He offered me the option to leave unless I wanted to stay. There were no changes to my salary or compensation, but I wanted to quit. 

Unfortunately, the market conditions are awful, and I've had no luck finding another job (I have applied for 100 roles). 

I've been doing my job for a couple of months now, but I feel super weird about the situation. I'm no longer invited to meetings, have no contact with the CEO, and don't travel anymore. I'm considering going back to my home country, but I'm also close to applying for citizenship at the end of the year. I want to pass the bar exam since I'm qualified for that and see if it opens up better opportunities. Right now, I'm staying mainly because of my kids and wife. I feel totally vulnerable at this point and don't know what to do.

Any advice is more than welcome.

Dear reddit, advice wanted. 

I want to drop out of my 4 year college. I haven’t even started. I’m going to be a freshman. 
I’ve paid my tuition, i’m registered for classes, and I have a pretty cool roommate. What could the issue be?

Well, i realized a few things. 

I won’t be happy with a four year degree. Look, i’m currently going into neuroscience. It’s truly my passion and something I enjoy but to be honest I don’t like any of the career outcomes. The careers i’m more interested in require graduate degrees and I don’t have the patience nor motivation to complete a masters (honestly PhD preferred). 
While i was finishing high school I actually told myself i’ll go get my bachelor then a 2 year associates because i realized half way through my senior year i wanted to be an x/ray technician. By then i had already finished all my college applications and gotten accepted into every school i applied for. during high school i did dual enrollment which allowed me to take classes at a community college and i absolutely LOVED IT. i’ve taken almost all the required courses for the xray program. I only have 3 more classes to take to be able to apply for the program. 

Second, i’m scared of leaving home. It’s always been me and one of my parents (raised by said single parent) and grandparents. My grandparents have gotten to the age where they can’t live independently so my parent takes care of them. they are what we can call the “sandwich generation”. I don’t want to leave my parent alone to care for them. I want to be there to help like i was during high school. I’ll also miss my cats HEAVILY. i’ve had one of my cats since kindergarten and the other day i realized how old she was getting. I can’t leave her. I feel like i’m abandoning her. tearing up writing this. 


I don’t know what to do. I have a very good college credit GPA and i don’t want to go away, become depressed because all the classes i’m taking won’t count towards the x-ray program. what if i perform terribly in the classes then lose my good GPA. I’m so lost. I feel like i’m disappointing everyone around me if i drop out. I feel like i’ll be judged for going to community college. 


As stated, i already paid for the fall semester. Should i attempt one semester and see how it works out? It’s too late for me to also register for the fall 2024 semester at my community college.

1dh8vee,academia,Thesis supervisor keep flip flopping on his recommendations,"I'm kind of at my wits' end here. The time window for submitting everything and having it checked is shrinking and my supervisor not only answers once every 2 weeks, but also his recommendations go against his own words, and against what I've been taught here for the last 5 years. Admittedly my introduction to my MA thesis was in need of revision, but he first tells me it's fine, then tells me to change one part of it (which I do knowing it goes slightly against what I've been taught), and then tells me that I did it wrong. Before he also gave me an absolutely horrible formatting advice too that I just refuse to use, and now this lack of change seems okay to him...

While I still am willing to make the introduction the way he wants it to be, he just told me to cite sources in my conclusion? Is that something people do? I've honestly saw this maybe twice in my life in some medicine-related papers, but never in humanities. I've always been taught that the concluding section is a piece of text that summarises the research done that draws conclusions, and summaries don't typically use sources. At the same time what's point of it? I've cited everyone in the chapters, those are conclusions of these people cited, or my conclusions based on other people I've cited, this just does not make any sense. The real question I want to ask, I suppose, is do you cite sources in conclusions? It just seems counter-intuitive, especially since the introduction kind of does a summary with a few sources for the reader...

I can't really make a deal out of it, because I won't get it dealt with on time, and the supervisor is also known to make your life difficult if you go against him.

Sorry for a bit of a rant, but I'm losing my mind here trying to decrypt which of his advice should and should not be followed.",2024-06-16 14:33:23,13,18,0,Positive,0.05471014492753623,0,0,2

1erjoma,college,"Is it normal that I don,t want to participate to my group's weekend integration ?","Sorry for the bad english it's my second langage  : 

So little backstory, I am going back to school after a few years off spent doing some living and working, and the school I attend has a reputation for being very party-heavy. Back in the day I would've enjoyed this culture and embraced it (probably would've been an ambassador of it lol, I was pretty wild from 16-21) but I don't even consume substances anymore (made a cross on coffee, nicotine, weed and most importantly alcohol). I'm going to school to get my degree and I really want to focus on having great grades, yet I know that college is also a great opportunity to network. The thing is, I've recently been added to a facebook group by one of the ""admins"" of my group from previous years, in which all the ""ambassadors"" say they look forward to meeting us for the integrations and then they all proceed to shotgun a beer. They then tag a few ""rookies"" (freshmans, such as myself) and ask them to send a video of themselves doing a shotgun. Now people are starting to send videos of them doing exactly that. I find this completely stupid and cringe. Am I being an oldhead ? (I'm not even 25). I want to network and stuff but going to events where I know people will just be shitfaced to preserve the school's traditions just seems like a bunch of no-fun. Oh and the ticket to enter the integrations is 120$ for three days. Will I look weird and be left appart from the rest of my group (we all share the same classes for the first year, which is pretty cool and helps to socialize imo) ?

I recently finished college and have a graduate job lined up for September in finance/ fund accounting. The thing is, I know I do not want to do fund accounting in the future it was just the only job that I could get that had hybrid working and in a location were I can public transport to. 

I personally wanted to a graduate programme in a more accountant based job such as working at the big 4 in auditing, or doing an accounting and finance programme in a big company, however i did not have any luck and got rejected from all these jobs.

The position that I have lined up is a two year contract and offer to pay for qualifications I pursue during this period so long as I pass the exams and stay the duration of the two years e.g. CFA, CPA. 

I also have the option to a masters program for a diploma in accounting however this costs about €12k and I would preferably like to start earning some money

What would be the best option? To do the accounting exams while working the job and try to find a more accounting related job after a year or 2, or do a masters Programm for a year? After one year I will have the opportunity to have the same amount of accounting exams passed with each of these options.



I am from Ireland btw

How did you keep yourself from getting discouraged? And at what stage of life do things really turn from 'just a job' to 'a career I'll do for my entire life'?

1elzlpd,careeradvice,Computer Science graduate wanting to switch to Marine Sciences. Which path to take?,"
Hello everyone. 

I’m 24, so let’s assume if I were to pursue further studies, I would start at 25.

I’m from South America. 

Firstly, I am aware that marine sciences is a very competitive field and that I will earn more (probably) working in computer science. 

I never really loved computer science, I just did it because it was what was recommended to me by my father. 

My true interest lie in marine sciences, or anything related to nature and animals, to be honest. 

I researched some options:

1. Pursue a master in Marine Environmental Sciences in Germany, as they take CS graduates. (Duration of 2 years)

2. Pursue another bachelor, but this time in Biology/Marine Biology, then a master’s in the same field. (Duration would be 5 years)

3. Pursue a master in Bioinformatics in Queensland, Australia, as they have a strong connection with the marine sciences department to conduct joint research. (Duration of 2 years)

4. Pursue a graduate certificate or diploma in Marine Sciences, then a master’s. (Duration of 2.5-3 years)

And then after each of those options I would pursue a Doctoral degree in Marine Sciences. 

The shortest paths would take around 5-6 years, and I would be 30-31 by the end of it. 

The longest would probably take around 8-9 years, and I would be 33-34 by the end of it. 

I’m not sure which path to take. 

Ideally I would prefer to work in a more hands on way, so occasionally doing field work. Due to that, I kinda think another bachelor would be more ideal, since I would have all the foundation that employers, particularly in the research field, may value. 

I worry that with a master in marine environmental sciences or bioinformatics, but without a bachelor in the field, PhD programs wouldn’t take me, and if they do, I wouldn’t get a research position after. 

I would really appreciate a more insightful view of my situation. 

Thank you.

I want to be good for others and I want to provide the same care for people that I wasn’t provided when I needed it (not blaming my family at all, I just kept things to myself).

I reached out to X a few times on X's personal email to propose some other business development opportunities and to let X know that I was excited that X would be coming to the conference, but X didn't respond.

I have an online meeting with X and another person today, which was scheduled before I insulted X.  X already wrote to confirm it: ""Looking forward to speaking at 3pm today, warmly, X"".

I'd like to apologize to X by saying how highly I think of X, that X is always welcome, and that X has an open door here, and that I may have insulted X through how I came across when we spoke about the conference, and I'd like to say that directly to X.  **OK to say to X, ""do you have a minute before or after today's meeting for a quick 1-on-1, as I would like to make amends for something I think I did""?**

It came as a relief because in my heart I didn't want to do that my whole life and missed research, but hated my old research group. The high energy physics experiment I worked on used a very very very old codebase, horrid to use, and the experiment was a large collaboration which made my work feel insignificant. Also because it was in a foreign country in a very different timezone, there were meetings at insane hours and was difficult to work dealing with chronic pain around that. Not to mention the sexist/racist microagressions within the Physics dept of the university I was associated with.  I knew I didn't want to do a postdoc in high energy physics at all after the PhD.

I left the PhD swearing off academia entirely, but the dull, draining experience as a trainee attorney has made me rethink some things.
